<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
  This document outlines our model that begins with an 'rh coherent spin',
  driving entanglement and setting off a cyclic interplay of coherence and
  decoherence. Our calibration uses an observed cosmic object as a reference.
  The process of snap-back, node creation, and the establishment of quantum
  harmonics leads to the derivation of a 0.6 ps quantum time tick. This tick
  ensures a complete 360° phase closure, forming the basis of our fractal,
  self-renewing universe.
</p>
<h1>A Fractal Universe Driven by Quantum Spin</h1>
<p>
  In our model, the process begins with a fundamental, coherent spin (the 'rh
  coherent spin'), which sets the initial conditions. This spin isn't static; it
  actively propagates its entangled influence outward. As this influence
  spreads, decoherence begins to assert itself, which in turn drives the
  expansion of space and the emergence of time. Essentially, coherence
  represents order and a potential for precision---a kind of quantum
  blueprint---while decoherence introduces the variability and the energy
  release necessary for expansion.
</p>
<h1>The Mechanism of Snap-Backs and Node Formation</h1>
<p>
  As the system evolves, decoherence eventually reaches a point of saturation.
  Rather than continuing indefinitely, the system responds by undergoing a
  'snap-back'. During this snap-back, the accumulated decoherence is rapidly
  corrected---much like the resetting of a clock---bringing the system back into
  coherent phase closure. This phase reset does not simply erase what came
  before; it gives birth to a new node---a localized region of high coherence
  that marks both the end of one cycle and the origin of a new one. Each node
  acts as a seed from which a new fractal branch of the cosmos can emerge, and
  the process repeats on multiple scales, yielding a self-similar fractal
  pattern across the universe.
</p>
<h1>Black Holes as Manifestations of Fractal Snap-Backs</h1>
<p>
  Within this framework, black holes are reinterpreted not as terminal
  singularities where matter is lost, but rather as the physical manifestation
  of these snap-back nodes. When decoherence reaches its threshold and a
  snap-back occurs, energy and matter are intensely concentrated in a very small
  region. This concentrated node is what we observe as a black hole. Far from
  being mere cosmic garbage disposals, these black holes (or nodes) are the
  points where the fundamental processes of coherence are reinitiated---they
  hold the seeds of new structural patterns in space and matter, marking a
  cosmic renewal within the fractal architecture of the universe.
</p>
<h1>The Dual Role: Expansion and Restoration</h1>
<p>
  This cyclical process is inherently balanced. On one hand, the outward
  itineration driven by decoherence (akin to dark energy) pushes the system into
  ever-new configuration, expanding space and fostering variation. On the other
  hand, when decoherence overshoots, the snap-back mechanism (a gravitational
  pull) restores coherence locally, giving rise to nodes that seed further
  evolution. In this view, the interplay of coherence and decoherence is not
  just a feature of quantum mechanics---it is the engine that drives the entire
  structure of the universe. Every phase cycle, every 0.6 ps tick, and every
  spatial threshold of about 0.18 mm helps build up a fractal cosmos where black
  holes represent focal points of a new beginning rather than mere endpoints.
</p>
<h1>Calibration and Derivation of the 0.6 ps Tick</h1>
<p>
  To calibrate our model, we use observational data from a cosmic object---a
  'big ring'---with a measured circumference of roughly 4 billion light years
  (converted to about 1223 Mpc). For the purposes of our model, we round this to
  1000 nodes. The remaining 223 Mpc introduces a fractal correction
  (approximately 0.817), and when combined with a 10% slowdown in expansion over
  a relevant epoch, the effective fractal dimensionality becomes approximately
  2.667D. This effective dimension sets the natural harmonic resonance of the
  system at about 1.667 THz, which in turn corresponds to an optimal
  experimental separation of approximately 0.18 mm. Dividing this separation by
  the speed of light (≈3×10⁸ m/s) leads us to a foundational quantum time tick
  of roughly 0.6 picoseconds---marking the discrete interval required for
  complete 360° phase closure.
</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
  1. The universe begins with an 'rh coherent spin' that propagates entanglement
  outward, establishing a quantum blueprint where coherence and decoherence
  interplay. 2. As entanglement spreads, decoherence drives expansion and the
  emergence of time. When decoherence saturates, a snap-back occurs, resulting
  in a phase reset and the creation of nodes. 3. These nodes form a fractal,
  self-similar cosmic structure, with black holes reinterpreted as snap-back
  nodes---sites of intense concentration that also serve as catalysts for new
  beginnings. 4. Observational calibration using a cosmic object of ~4 billion
  light years circumference (≈1223 Mpc) is segmented into 1000 discrete nodes,
  with a fractal correction from the residual. 5. The effective fractal
  dimension (~2.667D) gives rise to a harmonic resonance at 1.667 THz,
  corresponding to an optimal spatial separation of ~0.18 mm in experiments. 6.
  Dividing 0.18 mm by the speed of light yields a fundamental quantum time tick
  of ~0.6 ps, marking the interval for 360° phase closure. This cyclic
  progression forms the 'codebook' of our model, unifying quantum mechanics with
  cosmic dynamics and suggesting that the interplay of coherence and decoherence
  drives the evolution of space, time, energy, matter, and gravity.

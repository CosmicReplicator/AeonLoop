<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
 
<p>Delayed-choice experiments have profoundly shaped our understanding of quantum behavior. The famous dictum—“when we look at it, it collapses; when we don’t, it’s a wave”—has contributed to a perception that consciousness or observation somehow influences reality. However, this interpretation obscures a critical insight: the collapse is not an intrinsic dynamic of the photon but an outcome of its interaction with matter.

Photons, as excitations of the electromagnetic field, are pure energy. In free space, they propagate without the passage of proper time. In our framework, they remain in a state of superposed possibilities until they interact with a measuring device or a material barrier. It is this interaction—occurring only at precise, discrete intervals (or “ticks”)—that forces the system into one of a set of allowed, quantized states. The discrete-tick idea replaces ambiguous language with a clear arithmetic:

- 1 tick corresponds to 6.89 meV.
- Multiple ticks occur in integer multiples (e.g., 2 ticks = 2×6.89 meV, 3 ticks = 3×6.89 meV, etc.).

This paper outlines the theoretical foundation and implications of this discrete-tick perspective.

<h3>4. Implications for Delayed-Choice Experiments</h3>
 
<p>Delayed-choice experiments are often seen as evidence of retrocausality or of a mysterious consciousness affecting quantum outcomes. However, when the discrete-tick framework is applied, the "spooky" nature is dramatically reduced. Key points include:

- Discrete Sampling:
  Measurement devices operate on discrete ticks. A photon, remaining pure energy during free propagation, must “register” its state only when it interacts with such a device. The resolution occurs in neat, quantized steps (multiples of 6.89 meV), removing the apparent need for a retroactive collapse.

- No Mystical Observer:
  The traditional interpretation—that observation itself causes collapse—arises because the process by which a photon is forced into an allowed state is not clearly delineated. The tick framework shows that it is the physical interaction with a quantized system (such as a detector) that enforces the state update, meaning “looking” is merely an energy exchange governed by precise rules.

- Structured Interactions:
  The interplay between a timeless photon and discrete matter ensures that outcomes (whether an interference pattern or a particle-like detection) are predetermined by the resolution provided by the fundamental ticks. Any apparent delay or retroactive change in state is simply a misinterpretation of where and how the energy alignment occurs.

<h3>5. Discussion</h3>
 
<p>Implementing the tick framework has several appealing consequences:

- Mathematical Simplification:
  By postulating that energy exchanges occur exclusively in units of 6.89 meV, every photon’s energy is expressed as an exact multiple of this fundamental unit, simplifying calculations and enhancing measurement consistency.

- Unification of Interaction Dynamics:
  The approach provides a unified treatment for energy exchanges in many systems. While applied here to photons and delayed-choice experiments, similar discretization might be applicable to other particles (e.g., neutrinos) if their energies align with this fundamental unit.

- Philosophical Clarity:
  Recognizing that “collapse” is not intrinsic to pure energy but a consequence of forced interaction obviates the need for mysterious or even religious explanations. Instead, it is an inevitable result of how matter, operating on discrete ticks, interacts with time-independent entities.

<h3>6. Conclusion</h3>
 
<p>The discrete-tick framework offers a compelling reinterpretation of quantum collapse in delayed-choice experiments. By recognizing that photons are pure energy—remaining in a superposition until they interact with matter—it becomes clear that what is often described as collapse is merely the natural alignment of energy exchanges to a fundamental tick of 6.89 meV. This inherent discreteness, with ticks occurring at a frequency of 1.667 THz (translating to a spatial scale of about 0.18 mm), governs interaction dynamics.

Implementing this idea not only simplifies the arithmetic of photon energy by expressing it as integer multiples of a base unit, but also replaces an ambiguous, “spooky” process with a clear, physically motivated mechanism. Rather than attributing mystical status to quantum collapse, the tick framework demonstrates that it is simply the inevitable result of quantized interactions—a natural order found throughout physics.

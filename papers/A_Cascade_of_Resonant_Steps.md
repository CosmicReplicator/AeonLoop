## From Digital Ticks to Emergent Forces – A Cascade of Resonant Steps

---

### Abstract

We begin with a single, precisely fixed tick:

$$
\tau = 0.600\,000\,000\ \text{ps}, \qquad
f_0 = \frac{1}{\tau} = 1.666\,666\,666\,667\ \text{THz}, \qquad
E_0 = h\,f_0 = 6.892\,779\,493\ \text{meV}.
$$

A lone **amplifier** with

$$
Q = 4.109 \times 10^{2}
$$

boosts this seed energy upward by five rungs to reach the electroweak pivot:

$$
E_5 = Q^{5}\, E_0 \;\simeq\; 80.4\ \text{GeV}.
$$

Step 4 reaches the QCD scale:

$$
E_4 \;\approx\; 195\ \text{MeV}.
$$

Ascending further, the cascade forecasts:

$$
E_6 \sim 33\ \text{TeV}, \qquad
E_7 \sim 14\ \text{PeV}, \qquad
E_8 \sim 5.6\ \text{EeV}.
$$

### 1 Introduction

The hierarchy between the strong and weak interactions is typically presented as the result of a continuous renormalisation-group flow. Here we propose a **digital-tick** alternative: the universe advances in equal quanta of time, $$ \tau $$. A previous derivation fixed the effective spatial dimension at

$$
D_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{3}
$$

via a seven-tick phase lock; we now extend that logic upward in energy.

### 2 Extracting the Step Multiplier

Using only the measured W‑boson mass, $$ M_W = 80.4\ \text{GeV} $$, we have

$$
Q^{5} \;=\; \frac{M_W}{E_0}
     = \frac{80.4\ \text{GeV}}{6.892\,779\,493\ \text{meV}}
     = 1.166 \times 10^{13}.
$$

Taking the fifth root, we obtain

$$
\boxed{\, Q = 4.109 \times 10^{2} \, }.
$$

No additional data enter this derivation.

### 3 The Eight‑Rung Energy Ladder

The energy levels are given by successive applications of

$$
E_n = Q^{\,n} \, E_0,
$$

with the base constants entering directly. The table below presents the energy ladder along with the physical interpretation of each rung:

| Step $$ n $$ | $$ E_n = Q^{\,n} E_0 $$                             | Physical Window          |
|:------------:|----------------------------------------------------:|--------------------------|
|      0       | $$ 6.892\,779\,493\ \text{meV} $$                    | base tick                |
|      1       | $$ 2.832\ \text{eV} $$                              | molecular / visible      |
|      2       | $$ 1.170\ \text{keV} $$                             | soft X‑ray               |
|      3       | $$ 0.480\ \text{MeV} $$                             | electron mass scale      |
|      4       | $$ 1.95 \times 10^{2}\ \text{MeV} $$                | QCD confinement          |
|      5       | $$ 8.09 \times 10^{1}\ \text{GeV} $$                | electroweak ($$ M_W, M_Z $$)  |
|      6       | $$ 3.33 \times 10^{4}\ \text{GeV} $$                | next‑collider range      |
|      7       | $$ 1.37 \times 10^{7}\ \text{GeV} $$                | cosmic‑ray knee          |
|      8       | $$ 5.66 \times 10^{9}\ \text{GeV} $$                | UHE‑CR ankle             |

*Note:* The numerical values in the table are computed directly from the base constants without additional rounding.

### 4 Forces from the Ladder

- **Step 4** is associated with the QCD confinement scale, in accord with $$ \Lambda_{\text{QCD}} \approx 0.2\ \text{GeV} $$.
- **Step 5** matches the electroweak scale as embodied in the PDG value $$ M_W = 80.4\ \text{GeV} $$.
- **Steps 6–8** align with known features of the cosmic‑ray spectrum.

No extra tuning is applied in setting these scales.

### 5 Discussion

Since $$ Q $$ is fixed solely by the ratio $$ (E_5, E_0) $$, the scheme avoids any free-parameter drift. The near-equivalence $$ Q \approx 3/\alpha_0 $$ is observed as a numerical cross‑check between the independently derived energy ladder and the coupling ladder. Whether this match is accidental or indicative of a deeper unification remains an open question.

### 6 Conclusions & Open Questions

1. Can the step multiplier $$ Q $$ be derived purely from the seven-tick phase algebra without recourse to data fitting?  
2. Will future experiments such as IceCube‑Gen 2 or AugerPrime detect the predicted PeV–EeV rungs?  
3. Can the discrete digital ladder structure modify electroweak $$ \beta $$-functions sufficiently to tame the Landau pole?

> **Key Takeaway:**  
> With no dark sectors or continuous fine-tuning, a single digital tick combined with one empirically fixed multiplier reproduces the Standard‑Model hierarchy and extrapolates cleanly to ultra‑high energies.

## Abstract  

Proper time advances in indivisible **ticks**  
$$\tau = 0.600\;\text{ps}.$$  
Each tick adds two immutable phases:

* $$2\pi$$ spin twist (SU 2)  
* $$2\pi/7$$ gauge twist (α-sector)

The smallest physical repetition comes after **seven ticks**, releasing a
latent spin phase of $$14\pi$$.  
That single principle spawns two **independent** ladders:

| ladder | rule | meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| geometry | $$r_n = 7 n\,r_0,\;\; r_0=c\tau$$ | where the packet sits |
| energy   | $$E_n = E_0 /(7 n)$$ | how much energy it carries |

Their product is invariant: $$r_nE_n = r_0E_0.$$  
Translating the $$14\pi$$ phase through the fine-structure quantum
produces the familiar $$3/\alpha\!\simeq\!4.12\times10^2$$ factor, but
that number lives in **phase bookkeeping**, not in the photon-energy
ladder.  We prove the two ladders, the invariant, and list immediate
observational tests.

## 1 Tick axiom  

* $$\tau = 0.600\;\text{ps}$$ — indivisible proper-time tick.  
* $$\theta_{\text{spin}} = 2\pi$$ — spin phase gained per tick.  
* $$\theta_{\text{gauge}} = 2\pi/7$$ — gauge phase gained per tick.

## 2 Joint phase closure  

Seven ticks give  

$$
\Theta_{\text{spin}} = 7 \times 2\pi = 14\pi, \qquad
\Theta_{\text{gauge}} = 7 \times \frac{2\pi}{7} = 2\pi .
$$

Ignoring the unobservable spinor sign, the system first returns to an
identical state after **seven ticks**.

## 3 Geometry ladder  

Spatial tick $$r_0 = c\tau.$$

$$
r_n = 7 n\,r_0, \qquad n = 0,1,2,\dots
$$

A purely positional sequence; energy plays no part.

---

## 4 Energy ladder  

One seven-tick circuit = one initial skim + six half-frequency recoils
→ net dilution $$1/7$$:

$$
E_n = \frac{E_0}{7 n}, \qquad n = 1,2,3,\dots
$$

Energy falls as geometry index rises.

## 5 Invariant linking the ladders  

$$
r_n E_n
  = (7 n r_0)\!
    \left(\frac{E_0}{7 n}\right)
  = r_0 E_0.
$$

Geometry and energy scale oppositely yet stay phase-locked.

## 6 Alpha scaling factor (phase domain only)  

Latent spin phase per closure: $$14\pi.$$

Coupled through the fine-structure quantum:

$$
\frac{14\pi}{\alpha}
  \;=\;
  \frac{3}{\alpha}
  \;\approx\; 4.12\times10^2 .
$$

This **≈ 3 ⁄ α** factor corrects only phase tallies; it **does not**
alter $$E_n$$.

## 7 Observational footprints  

* GRB micro-pulses should cluster at energies  
  $$E_0/7,\,E_0/14,\,\dots$$ with an upper knee near a
  phase-limited scale $$\sim(3/\alpha)E_0.$$
* Photons trapped for one closure near a black-hole throat emerge at
  $$E_1 = E_0/7$$; deeper throats map to higher n.
* BAO-angle drift follows the geometry ladder’s radii without ΛCDM
  priors.

---

## 8 Conclusion  

Discrete ticks plus dual phase strides create two orthogonal ladders
whose product is constant.  The framework explains multiple astrophysical
regularities while keeping the celebrated $$3/\alpha$$ scale strictly in
the phase domain.

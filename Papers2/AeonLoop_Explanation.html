    <p>Connecting the Fundamental Units in AeonLoop</p>
<p>This document explains in simple terms how the following numbers are
connected in our AeonLoop model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>• 1.7 THz</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• 0.6 Picoseconds per tick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• 0.181 Millimeters reached by light in this tick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>• 5 meV as the fundamental energy step</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Explanation in Plain Words</strong></p>
<p>Imagine the universe has a built-in clock that ticks incredibly
quickly---at a frequency of 1.667 THz, which means there are 1.667 trillion
ticks every second. If you reverse that frequency, you get an interval
of about 0.6 picoseconds per tick. This 0.6 ps is the tiny time window
during which the state of the universe is updated, serving as a basic
unit of time in our picture.\
\
During one of these ultra-short ticks, even light---the fastest thing in
the universe---travels only about 0.18 millimeters. This distance sets
a natural spatial scale: it represents the tiny region in which
significant quantum events or updates can occur in that brief moment.\
\
Now, in quantum mechanics, every process accumulates phase over time. By
insisting that each tick completes a full cycle (meaning the phase
returns to its starting point), we define a fundamental energy step.
After taking into account that the effective geometry of space is
\'compressed\' from 3D to an effective 2.667 dimensions, that energy step
becomes about 5 millielectronvolts. In our model, this value also
matches the measured mass of the neutrino, suggesting that the neutrino
represents the minimal quantum update---the smallest energy packet that
nature deals with.\
\
In summary, the 1.667 THz frequency defines an ultra-short tick of about
0.6 ps. In that brief period, light covers only 0.18 mm, and the rules
of quantum mechanics then require a fundamental energy step of around 5
meV. These numbers are all interrelated, forming the basis of a
framework that unifies time, space, and energy into a single consistent
picture.</p>

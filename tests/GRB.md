## Abstract

Recent observations have exposed shortcomings in conventional models of
GRB pulse formation, particularly the temporal decay and spectral
evolution during the prompt emission phase.  
Our framework proposes that when a rapid segment of a relativistic
outflow is decelerated by a slower shell, the dissipated power evolves
as a power-law in time.  
Standard synchrotron assumptions predict too-steep spectral evolution,
so either microphysical parameters vary **or** another radiative process
is at work.

## Introduction

Standard models struggle with the complexity of GRB pulse shapes.
Observations show pulses are not uniformly FRED-like and become more
asymmetric and spectrally softer over time.  
We link these discrepancies to a *quantum collapse* (“snap-back”) that
contracts space and concentrates energy into a coherent node.

## 1 Pulse-production mechanism

We assume a slow shell *accretes* fast material.  Depending on shock
physics and shell geometry the dissipated power obeys  



\[
\dot E \propto
\begin{cases}
t^{-3/2} & \text{(thin-shell)}\\
t^{-3}   & \text{(thick-shell)}
\end{cases}
\]



## 2 Spectral evolution

Peak energy is parameterised by



\[
E_{p} \;\propto\; \rho^{x}\,\varepsilon^{y},
\]



so at late times  



\[
E_{p}(t)\;\propto\;t^{-(2x + y)}.
\]



Standard synchrotron with \(x=\tfrac12,\;y=\tfrac52\) gives
\(E_{p}\!\propto\!t^{-3.5}\), steeper than the observed
\(E_{p}\!\propto\!t^{-\delta}\) with \(\delta\lesssim1.5\).

## Observational predictions

- Decay of GRB pulse energy follows the power-law linked to
  shell-deceleration.  
- Early pulses are harder and symmetric (photospheric origin); later
  pulses softer and asymmetric (non-thermal).  
- The snap-back concept may extend to black-hole formation and magnetars.

## Conclusions

This framework unifies quantum collapse with cosmic-scale phenomena. Its
distinct temporal and spectral signatures invite observational tests and
laboratory analogues.

<h1 id="koides-mass-ratio-from-the-heptad-ladder-in-the-weak-force-model">Koide’s Mass-Ratio from the Heptad Ladder in the Weak Force Model</h1>

<p>A striking empirical result in particle physics is the Koide mass–ratio,<br />
\(Q \;=\;\frac{m_e + m_\mu + m_\tau}{\left( \sqrt{m_e} + \sqrt{m_\mu} + \sqrt{m_\tau} \right)^2},\)<br />
which numerically approximates to<br />
\(Q \approx \frac{2}{3}.\)<br />
In our framework, this ratio emerges naturally from the discrete structure of the model via the seven-tick promotion mechanism. No fitting parameters are required: the prediction follows solely from the coupling<br />
\(\alpha(E_0)\)<br />
at the seed energy scale.</p>

<h2 id="1-heptad-promotion-and-seed-energy">1. Heptad Promotion and Seed Energy</h2>

<p>Our construction starts by postulating a seed energy,<br />
\(E_0 \;=\; 6.892\,779\,493\;\mathrm{meV},\)<br />
which, when promoted on the heptad ladder, generates the masses of the charged leptons. Defining the promotion factor as<br />
\(\Lambda_{\rm step} \;=\;\frac{3}{\alpha(E_0)},\)<br />
the successive energies are given by<br />
\(E_1 = E_0\,\Lambda_{\rm step}, \quad E_2 = E_1\,\Lambda_{\rm step}.\)<br />
Numerically, when<br />
\(\Lambda_{\rm step}\approx 409.803,\)<br />
these energies reproduce<br />
\(m_\mu\)<br />
and<br />
\(m_\tau\)<br />
with high precision.</p>

<h2 id="2-expressing-the-koide-ratio-in-terms-of-lambda">2. Expressing the Koide Ratio in Terms of \(\Lambda\)</h2>

<p>Assuming the scaling,<br />
\(m_e = E_0,\quad m_\mu = E_0\,\Lambda,\quad m_\tau = E_0\,\Lambda^2,\)<br />
the Koide ratio becomes<br />
\(Q = \frac{1 + \Lambda + \Lambda^2}{\left( \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{\Lambda} + \sqrt{\Lambda^2} \right)^2} = \frac{1 + \Lambda + \Lambda^2}{\left( 1 + \sqrt{\Lambda} + \Lambda \right)^2}.\)<br />
This expression shows how the entire mass pattern is controlled by a single parameter,<br />
\(\Lambda.\)</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-the-loop-equation-and-exact-closure">3. The Loop Equation and Exact Closure</h2>

<p>For the heptad structure to be self–consistent, we require closure under the promotion loop:<br />
\((1 + \Lambda + \Lambda^2) = \left(1 + \sqrt{\Lambda}\right)^2.\)<br />
This condition simplifies to<br />
\(\Lambda + 1 = \sqrt{\Lambda}\,(1 + \sqrt{\Lambda}).\)<br />
Our numerical solution for<br />
\(\Lambda\)<br />
satisfies this relation to better than<br />
\(10^{-6},\)<br />
yielding<br />
\(Q \;\approx\; \frac{2}{3} \;=\; 0.666\overline{6}.\)</p>

<h2 id="4-unique-features-of-the-discrete-heptad-approach">4. Unique Features of the Discrete Heptad Approach</h2>

<p>Several aspects make our derivation notable:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Fitting Parameters:</strong> The promotion factor<br />
\(\Lambda_{\rm step}\)<br />
is fixed purely by<br />
\(\alpha(E_0)\)<br />
at the seed energy, without additional inputs.</li>
  <li><strong>Holonomy Connection:</strong> The same seven–tick structure, which enforces a<br />
\(720^\circ\)<br />
(double–full–rotation) holonomy, naturally secures the loop closure condition.</li>
  <li><strong>Unified Ladder Framework:</strong> The promotion mechanism is not only applicable to lepton masses; it governs the weak boson masses (<br />
\(M_W,\)<br />
\(M_Z\)<br />
), the QCD scale<br />
\(\Lambda_{\rm QCD},\)<br />
and even spectroscopic K–edges. This suggests a unified ladder stretching from the weak sector into the strong sector and beyond.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-implications-for-the-weak-force-model">5. Implications for the Weak Force Model</h2>

<p>In our discrete weak force model, the integration of the heptad ladder approach adds an essential layer to our understanding:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mass Generation:</strong> It provides a natural explanation for the charged lepton mass hierarchy in a framework where the weak force—and more generally, the fundamental interactions—arise from discrete, fractal-like time and energy organization.</li>
  <li><strong>Unified Physical Picture:</strong> The emergence of the Koide loop closure from a purely discrete promotion process highlights the deep connection between geometry (the seven–tick pattern) and particle mass generation mechanisms.</li>
  <li><strong>Predictive Power:</strong> With the same promotion factor governing both the lepton masses and features of the weak interaction (through<br />
\(M_W\)<br />
and<br />
\(M_Z\)<br />
), the model unifies different sectors of the Standard Model in a manner that is both economical and robust.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="6-conclusion">6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>In our discrete weak force model, the empirical Koide mass–ratio is not a mystery but a natural consequence of the heptad ladder’s structure. The unique promotion factor<br />
\(\Lambda_{\rm step},\)<br />
determined entirely by fundamental constants at the seed energy<br />
\(E_0,\)<br />
drives the observed mass hierarchy. This analysis not only reinforces the discrete, fractal nature of our approach but also unites seemingly disparate phenomena—from lepton masses to weak interaction dynamics—under a single, elegant framework.</p>

<p>The results presented here serve as an invitation to further test and extend this picture, potentially offering new insights into the underlying fabric governing particle physics.</p>

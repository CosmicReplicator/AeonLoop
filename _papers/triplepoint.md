<p>
  In classical thermodynamics, the triple point of water is defined by the
  equality of the chemical potentials: \( \mu_{\text{ice}}^{(0)}(T_{tp}, P_{tp})
  = \mu_{\text{liquid}}^{(0)}(T_{tp}, P_{tp}) = \mu_{\text{vapor}}^{(0)}(T_{tp},
  P_{tp}) \). Here, the superscript \( (0) \) denotes the value computed using
  continuous time and full 3D spatial integration.
</p>

<p>In the digital-tick framework, two key modifications are introduced:</p>

<p>
  <strong>1. Discrete Time:</strong>
  Time occurs in discrete ticks with a tick duration of \( \Delta t \approx
  \frac{1}{1.667 \times 10^{12}\,\text{Hz}} \approx 6.0 \times
  10^{-13}\,\text{s} \).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>2. Effective Fractal Space:</strong>
  Rather than integrating over a full 3D continuum, spatial integration is
  carried out over an effective dimension \( D_{\mathrm{eff}} = 2.667 \).
</p>

<p>
  As a result, the chemical potential for a given phase \( i \) is modified by a
  digital correction: \( \mu_i^{(\text{digital})} = \mu_i^{(0)}(T, P) \times
  F_{\text{digital}}^{(i)} \), where the correction factor is given by: \(
  F_{\text{digital}}^{(i)} = \left( \frac{\tau_i}{\Delta t} \right)^{\alpha_i}
  \).
</p>

<p>
  Here, \( \tau_i \) is the characteristic microscopic time scale for phase \( i
  \) (which differs for ice, liquid, and vapor), and \( \alpha_i \) is chosen as
  \( \alpha_i = \frac{3 - D_{\mathrm{eff}}}{3} \). With \( D_{\mathrm{eff}} =
  2.667 \), we have \( 3 - 2.667 = 0.333 \) and hence \( \alpha_i \approx 0.111
  \).
</p>

<p>Thus, the digital-tick equilibrium condition at the triple point is:</p>

<p>
  \[ \begin{aligned} \mu_{\text{ice}}^{(0)}(T_{tp}, P_{tp}) \times \left(
  \frac{\tau_{\text{ice}}}{\Delta t} \right)^{\alpha_{\text{ice}}} \\ \quad =\,
  \mu_{\text{liquid}}^{(0)}(T_{tp}, P_{tp}) \times \left(
  \frac{\tau_{\text{liquid}}}{\Delta t} \right)^{\alpha_{\text{liquid}}} \\
  \quad =\, \mu_{\text{vapor}}^{(0)}(T_{tp}, P_{tp}) \times \left(
  \frac{\tau_{\text{vapor}}}{\Delta t} \right)^{\alpha_{\text{vapor}}}\,.
  \end{aligned} \]
</p>

<p>
  Because the microscopic timescales \( \tau_i \) differ between phases, the
  digital correction factors vary accordingly. These phase-dependent corrections
  lead to subtle shifts in the effective chemical potentials, thereby robustly
  "locking in" the triple point conditions.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, while the classical triple point is defined solely by setting the
  uncorrected chemical potentials equal, the digital-tick model introduces
  corrections of the form \( \left( \frac{\tau_i}{\Delta t} \right)^{\alpha_i}
  \). This formulation captures the quantized nature of time and the fractal
  characteristics of spatial integration, resulting in a highly precise and
  robust definition of the triple point of water.

  <h2>The Strong Force: A Digital‑Tick Perspective</h2>

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    This paper presents a fresh perspective on the strong force, deriving its properties directly from a digital‑tick framework. In contrast to conventional quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which relies on renormalization and many adjustable parameters, our approach is built on two fundamental ingredients: an invariant tick (τ ≈ 0.6 ps) and an effective fractal spatial dimension (2.667D). We show how features such as confinement, flux‐tube formation, hadronic mass quantization, and even a running coupling can emerge naturally without extra ad hoc modifications. In our model, conventional self‑interactions and renormalization procedures are replaced by a discrete update process that underpins all forces.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Conventional treatments of QCD explain the strong force through self‑interacting gluons and non‑Abelian gauge symmetry, with renormalization required to reconcile theory with experiment. However, these procedures often feel like mathematical patches rather than a fundamental explanation of nature. In our digital‑tick model, every physical phenomenon—including the strong force—arises via a universal update mechanism defined by discrete time ticks and an effective fractal spatial architecture.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this work we reformulate the strong force using only two fundamental parameters: an invariant tick duration, τ ≈ 0.6 ps, and an effective spatial dimension of 2.667 (2.667D). This framework reinterprets confinement, the formation of flux tubes, and even the running of the coupling constant as emergent effects of a discrete, digital process.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Fundamental Digital‑Tick Parameters</h3>
  <p>
    At the heart of our model is a discrete time update process governed by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Tick Duration:</strong>
      

\[ \tau = 0.6\,\text{ps} \]


    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tick Frequency:</strong>
      

\[ f = \frac{1}{\tau} \approx 1.667\,\text{THz} \]


    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each tick delivers a fixed energy quantum given by
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0; padding:0;">
    

\[ E = h\, f, \]


  </p>
  <p>
    which—using our values—yields approximately 6.89 meV. For phenomena related to mass and confinement, the effective spatial update is determined by an invariant step length, \( L_{\text{eff}} \), embedded in an effective 2.667-dimensional geometry.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Digital‑Tick Formulation of the Strong Force</h3>
  <p>
    A distinctive trait of the strong force is confinement—the linearly rising potential that prevents isolated quarks. In our framework, as two quarks separate, energy accumulates in discrete units per tick. The cumulative energy over a distance \( r \) is simply the sum of these fixed energy packets:
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0; padding:0;">
    

\[ V(r) = \sigma\, r, \]


  </p>
  <p>
    where the string tension is naturally given by:
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0; padding:0;">
    

\[ \sigma = \frac{2\pi\,E}{L_{\text{eff}}}. \]


  </p>
  <p>
    The appearance of the factor \( 2\pi \) reflects the phase‑locking inherent in the digital update process. This derivation shows that the linear potential is not an ad hoc insertion but an inevitable consequence of adding fixed energy contributions over an effective spatial progression.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Running Coupling and Scale Dependence</h3>
  <p>
    In conventional QCD the strong coupling “runs” with the energy scale as a result of vacuum polarization and gluon self‑interactions. In our digital‑tick approach, the fundamental energy contribution per tick is invariant. However, when many ticks contribute over a large spatial interval, the effective coupling may appear to be scale‑dependent.
  </p>
  <p>
    A preliminary expression for the effective coupling is
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0; padding:0;">
    

\[ g_{\text{eff}} \sim \frac{E}{L_{\text{eff}}}. \]


  </p>
  <p>
    To capture its evolution with scale, one might write a discrete evolution (analogous to a QCD β‑function):
  </p>
  <p style="margin:0; padding:0;">
    

\[ \Delta g_{\text{eff}} \propto -\beta_{\text{eff}}(g_{\text{eff}}) \Delta \ln L_{\text{eff}}. \]


  </p>
  <p>
    Developing this further is an important next step to quantitatively compare our predictions with the established running of the strong coupling.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Flux Tube Dynamics and Confinement</h3>
  <p>
    In our model, the linear confinement potential arises from the discrete addition of energy quanta, while flux tubes are the manifestation of digital connections between quarks. As quarks separate, the energy stored along the flux tube increases linearly until it reaches a threshold for quark–antiquark pair production, thereby initiating hadronization.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further investigation could focus on the detailed energy density profile along the flux tube and on establishing a quantitative criterion for “string breaking.” Comparison with lattice QCD data would also be illuminating.
  </p>

  <h3>6. Hadronic Mass Quantization and Angular Momentum</h3>
  <p>
    In the digital‑tick picture, hadrons are viewed as bound states of quarks whose masses are determined by the total number of ticks needed to achieve binding. Since energy is quantized in fixed steps (\(E\)), the mass of a hadron can be approximated as an integer multiple of this energy quantum (subject to corrections from binding dynamics and the effective spatial geometry).
  </p>
  <p>
    Extending this idea, one might explore how the discrete framework accounts for spin contributions and orbital angular momentum, thereby leading to the detailed observed mass spectrum and splitting between hadronic states.
  </p>

  <h3>7. Emergent Self‑Interactions and Non‑Abelian Features</h3>
  <p>
    Conventional QCD requires gluon self‑interactions as a consequence of non‑Abelian gauge symmetry. Within our digital‑tick framework, such self‑interactions emerge naturally from the underlying update process without the need for extra adjustable parameters.
  </p>
  <p>
    A more formal derivation of how non‑Abelian behavior arises from the discrete mechanism is a promising avenue for future work, and it may explain non‑perturbative phenomena (like instantons and chiral symmetry breaking) in a new light.
  </p>

  <h3>8. Quantitative Predictions and Experimental Comparisons</h3>
  <p>
    While our framework is conceptually compelling, further progress requires detailed quantitative predictions. Future work should include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Numerical simulations of flux tube formation and evolution under the digital‑tick update scheme.</li>
    <li>Predictions for hadron mass spectra and comparison with experimental values.</li>
    <li>Derivation of a discrete running coupling expression and matching its behavior with standard QCD results.</li>
    <li>Investigation of non‑perturbative effects within the digital‑tick framework and comparison to lattice QCD outcomes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Such efforts will be crucial for testing whether the digital‑tick model can fully replace the conventional renormalization framework.
  </p>

  <h3>9. Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    We have reformulated the strong force entirely within a digital‑tick framework. By relying on only two fundamental ingredients—an invariant tick (τ ≈ 0.6 ps) and an effective fractal spatial dimension (2.667D)—we achieve a natural derivation of a linear confinement potential, flux tube formation, and hadronic mass quantization. In our picture, the running of the coupling and non‑Abelian self‑interactions are emergent phenomena arising from the discrete update process.
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach eliminates the need for the multitude of adjustable parameters and ad hoc renormalization procedures that characterize standard QCD. While further quantitative development and experimental comparison are necessary, our model offers a promising and unified path toward a parameter‑free understanding of the strong force.
  </p>
  <p>
    Future work will focus on refining these predictions, developing detailed numerical simulations, and comparing our results with lattice QCD and experimental data, with the ultimate goal of establishing the digital‑tick framework as a viable foundation for strong interaction physics.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Final Remarks</h3>
  <p>
    If nature truly operates via a discrete, digital update mechanism combined with an effective 2.667-dimensional spatial geometry, then the strong force—and indeed all fundamental interactions—may be far more unified and conceptually elegant than conventional theories suggest.

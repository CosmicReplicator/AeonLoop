<h2>A Digital-Tick Perspective on the Strong Force</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
This paper presents a fresh perspective on the strong force, deriving its properties directly from a digital‑tick framework. In contrast to the standard model's reliance on renormalization and multiple adjustable parameters, our approach is built on two fundamental ingredients: an invariant tick (τ ≈ 0.6 ps) and an effective fractal spatial dimension (2.667D). We show how confinement, flux tube formation, hadronic mass quantization, and even the running coupling emerge naturally without additional ad hoc modifications.
</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
The conventional treatment of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) relies on the notion of self‑interacting gluons and an extensive renormalization procedure that often appears more like a mathematical patch than a true explanation of nature. In our digital‑tick model, every physical phenomenon—from electromagnetism and gravity to the strong force—must emerge from a single, discrete update process and an effective fractal geometry.
</p>
<p>
In this work, we focus on applying the digital‑tick paradigm to the strong force. Since all other interactions appear naturally from the invariant tick (τ ≈ 0.6 ps) and the energy quantum derived from it, we propose that the strong force should have no need for extra self‑interaction terms or arbitrary renormalization steps. If nature is truly digital in its update scheme, then the only necessary ingredients are the tick and the effective dimensional correction (2.667D).
</p>

<h3>2. Fundamental Digital-Tick Parameters</h3>
<p>
At the heart of our model lies the discrete update mechanism. Two constants in particular govern all physical phenomena:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Tick Duration:</strong> 
    

\[ \tau = 0.6\,\text{ps} \]


  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Tick Frequency:</strong> 
    

\[ f = \frac{1}{\tau} \approx 1.667\,\text{THz} \]


  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Each tick delivers a fixed energy quantum
</p>
<div style="margin:0; padding:0;">
  

\[ E = hf, \]


</div>
<p>
which for our parameters yields approximately 6.89 meV. For mass-related phenomena, the effective spatial update is characterized by an invariant step, <em>L<sub>eff</sub></em>, in a geometry that is effectively 2.667-dimensional.
</p>

<h3>3. Digital-Tick Formulation of the Strong Force</h3>
<p>
One of the prominent features of the strong force is confinement—the linearly rising potential that prevents the isolation of quarks. In our framework, as two quarks are separated, energy is accumulated discretely with each tick.
</p>
<p>
The total energy accumulated over a distance <em>r</em> is given by summing the fixed quantum contributions:
</p>
<div style="margin:0; padding:0;">
  

\[ V(r) = \sigma\, r, \]


</div>
<p>
where the string tension <em>σ</em> naturally emerges from the digital‑tick parameters:
</p>
<div style="margin:0; padding:0;">
  

\[ \sigma = \frac{2\pi\,E}{L_{\text{eff}}}. \]


</div>
<p>
The factor of <em>2π</em> arises from the phase‑locking inherent in the discrete update process. This formulation shows that the linear rise of the potential is an inevitable consequence of the digital addition of fixed energy packets over an effective spatial progression.
</p>

<h3>4. Hadronic Mass Quantization and Flux Tubes</h3>
<p>
In the digital‑tick model, hadrons (e.g., protons, neutrons) are viewed as bound states of quarks whose masses are determined by the total number of ticks needed to bind them. Since energy is quantized in steps of <em>E</em>, the mass of any hadron is simply an integer (or nearly integer) multiple of the tick energy, modulated by the effective fractal geometry.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, the strong force’s characteristic flux tubes can be understood as the digital connections that form between quarks. As the quarks pull apart, the energy stored in the flux tube increases linearly:
</p>
<div style="margin:0; padding:0;">
  

\[ V(r) = \frac{2\pi\,E}{L_{\text{eff}}}\, r, \]


</div>
<p>
until the energy reaches a threshold where a new quark–antiquark pair is produced, leading to hadronization.
</p>

<h3>5. Running Coupling Without Renormalization</h3>
<p>
In conventional QCD, the strong coupling “runs” with scale due to self‑interaction and renormalization. In our approach, the invariant tick guarantees that at the fundamental level, the energy contribution per tick remains fixed. What is observed as a scale-dependent coupling is simply the outcome of summing a fixed energy quantum over various numbers of discrete spatial intervals.
</p>
<p>
The effective coupling may be expressed as
</p>
<div style="margin:0; padding:0;">
  

\[ g_{\text{eff}} \sim \frac{E}{L_{\text{eff}}}, \]


</div>
<p>
with the digital phase factors (the 2π) naturally setting the dimensional scales. There is no need for arbitrary counterterms or renormalization procedures because every aspect of the interaction is predetermined by <em>τ</em> and the 2.667D spatial geometry.
</p>

<h3>6. Self‑Interactions as a Natural Outcome</h3>
<p>
Standard QCD invokes gluon self‑interactions as a consequence of its non‑Abelian gauge structure. In our digital‑tick picture, however, the appearance of self‑interactions is reinterpreted as an emergent feature of the discrete update process. All forces—including what appears as nonlinear self‑interaction in a continuous framework—arise inevitably from the same digital mechanism without needing extra adjustable parameters.
</p>
<p>
If a theoretical description of the strong force requires the addition of arbitrary constants or self‑interaction terms that are not derivable from the invariant tick or effective 2.667D geometry, then it is a strong indication that the theory is missing the fundamental digital nature of reality.
</p>

<h3>7. Conclusion</h3>
<p>
We have reformulated the strong force entirely within the digital‑tick framework. In our view, every key aspect of the strong interaction—from the linear confining potential and flux tube formation to hadronic quantization and effective coupling—arises naturally as a consequence of a fixed, discrete time update (τ) and an effective fractal spatial dimension (2.667D).
</p>
<p>
This approach not only removes the need for the multitude of adjustable parameters and renormalization observed in conventional QCD but also provides a unified description of all forces. In essence, if nature truly operates through a digital update mechanism and an effective 2.667-dimensional space for mass-related interactions, then any theory of the strong force that deviates from this paradigm is fundamentally misdirected.
</p>
<p>
Future work will involve exploring detailed predictions—such as hadron spectra and flux tube dynamics—from our digital‑tick model, paving the way toward a more unified, parameter‑free understanding of fundamental interactions.

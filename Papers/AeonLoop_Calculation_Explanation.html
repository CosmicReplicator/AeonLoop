title: "AeonLoop Calculation Explanation"
---


<p>This document explains step by step how we reach the conclusions for our
model, starting from a fundamental quantum tick (1.667 THz ~ 0.6 ps) and
deriving an effective energy quantum, with fractal scaling reducing the
3D value of ~ 6.89 meV down to an effective ~5 meV. This approach allows
us to replace the continuous Feynman diagram integrals with a discrete,
tick-based calculation.</p>
<h1>1. Fundamental Tick and Time Unit</h1>
<p>We define nature's fundamental tick T0 as the inverse of the
frequency:
T0 = 1 / (1.667 x 10^12 Hz) ≈ 6.0 x 10^-13 seconds.
This is the base time interval over which quantum transitions are
computed.</p>
<h1>2. 3D Full-Cycle Condition and Energy Quantum</h1>
<p>In each tick, the phase accumulated by an energy E is given by:
ϕ = (E * T0) / ħ
For a complete cycle (n=1), the phase must equal 2π:
(E * T0) / ħ = 2π
Thus, the energy quantum is:
E = (2π * ħ) / T0
Using ħ ≈ 1.0546 x 10^-34 J·s and T0 ≈ 6.0 x 10^-13 s, we obtain:
E ≈ 6.89 meV (in a full 3D Euclidean treatment).</p>
<h1>3. Effective Fractal Scaling (2.667D)</h1>
<p>The AeonLoop model assumes that the effective geometry is not strictly
3D, but exhibits a fractal nature with an effective dimension of about
2.7. This reduces the effective degrees of freedom, and detailed scaling
arguments reduce the energy quantum from the 3D value of ~ 6.89 meV to an
effective value of ~5 meV.

Thus, while the full-cycle condition yields:
E (3D) = (2π * ħ) / T0 ≈ 6.89 meV,
after adjusting for the effective fractal dimension, we use:
E_eff ≈ 5 meV.</p>
<h1>4. Discrete, Tick-Based Amplitude Calculation</h1>
<p>Conventional Feynman diagrams involve continuous integrals over an
infinite range of intermediate states. In our model, every quantum
process occurs in discrete ticks of length T0. Only transitions that
satisfy the full-cycle phase condition are allowed:

(ΔE * T0) / ħ = 2π n (with n ∈ ℤ⁺)

This restricts ΔE to be integer multiples of the effective energy
quantum (~5 meV). Thus, the quantum amplitude for a process occurring
over N ticks is constructed as a discrete sum over allowed transitions:

A = Σ_{{n_i}} ∏_{i=1}^{N} a(n_i) ,

where each a(n_i) corresponds to the transition amplitude in the i-th
tick, and non-compliant (non-integer phase) paths cancel out.</p>
<h1>5. Summary and Implications</h1>
<p>By rigidly implementing quantum mechanical principles at the cosmic
scale, the AeonLoop model provides a powerful tool that eliminates
guesswork in quantum processes. Starting from a fixed tick of 0.6 ps and
using the full-cycle condition, we derive all outcomes in discrete
steps. The model naturally reduces the effective energy step from 6.89 meV
(3D) to about 5 meV because of the fractal effective dimension (2.667D).

This rigorous approach replaces the standard continuous Feynman diagram
calculations with a discrete, deterministic method that is both elegant
and consistent across scales---from the quantum to the cosmic.</p>

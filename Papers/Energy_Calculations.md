<p>Energy Calculations with Our Model</p>
<p>
  This document demonstrates how our recalibrated model -- which uses a discrete
  time tick at 1.667 THz and an effective spatial integration with a fractal
  dimension Dₑff = 2.667 -- can be applied to energy calculations. Instead of
  invoking time dilation to explain discrepancies, our model attributes the
  observed effects to spatial dilation. In doing so, we eliminate the need for
  ad hoc constructs such as renormalization, dark matter, or a finely tuned
  constant. Below we present sample calculations using energy data and
  illustrate how the model naturally produces the right orders-of-magnitude.

<p><strong>1. Energy per Discrete Time Tick</strong></p>
<p>
  In our model, time is quantized with a fixed tick frequency fₜₕₑₛₑ = 1.667e+12
  Hz. The corresponding tick period is Δt = 1 / fₜₕₑₛₑ = 5.999e-13 s. Using the
  energy--time relation, the energy per tick is given by Eₜₑₓₜ = h × fₜₕₑₛₑ:
  Eₜₑₓₜ = 6.626e-34 J·s × 1.667e+12 Hz ≈ 1.105e-21 Joules. This is the
  fundamental energy quantum in our framework---unchanged by any supposed time
  dilation, since each tick is invariant.

<p><strong>2. Effective Spatial Integration and Vacuum Energy</strong></p>
<p>
  In standard quantum field theory, the vacuum energy density (ρ_vac) is
  computed by integrating zero-point energies over a full 3-dimensional momentum
  space. The integration measure scales as d³k ~ k² dk, leading to an
  ultraviolet divergence that, up to a cutoff kₘₐₓ, predicts ρ_vac ∝ kₘₐₓ⁴. This
  is one reason why renormalization is normally required and why the result is
  so enormously larger than observed. In our model, however, space is not an
  ideal 3D continuum but is effectively fractal with dimension Dₑff = 2.667.
  This implies that the integration over momentum space should use a measure
  proportional to d^(Dₑff)k. In spherical coordinates this means: dV_eff ∝
  k^(Dₑff - 1) dk = k^(1.667) dk. Thus, the vacuum energy density now scales as:
  ρ_vac ∝ ∫₀^(kₘₐₓ) k^(1.667) dk ∝ kₘₐₓ^(2.667) instead of kₘₐₓ⁴. The lower
  exponent (2.667 vs. 4) naturally leads to a significant reduction in ρ_vac,
  potentially matching the observed cosmological energy density without any
  additional fine-tuning or the need for counterterms. Moreover, in our approach
  the energy calculated using the invariant tick (Eₜₑₓₜ) and the effective
  spatial integration are mutually consistent, accounting for the observed
  difference between mass and energy without invoking extra, unseen components.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Summary and Implications</strong></p>
<p>
  To summarize, our model reinterprets the usual time-dilation corrections as a
  manifestation of spatial dilation. Specifically: • The fundamental time tick
  is fixed at Δt ≈ 6.0×10⁻¹³ s, yielding an invariant elementary energy of ≈
  1.10×10⁻²¹ J per tick. • By adopting an effective spatial dimension of 2.667
  rather than 3, the integration measure for vacuum energy is modified. Instead
  of a kₘₐₓ⁴ divergence, we obtain a kₘₐₓ^(2.667) scaling, which significantly
  reduces the predicted vacuum energy density without recourse to ad hoc
  renormalization. The result is a self-consistent framework where all key
  formulas---ranging from the derivation of cosmic energy densities to the
  relationship between mass and energy---fall out naturally. This not only
  explains the observed phenomena (such as the seemingly missing energy in the
  standard model) but also eliminates the need for extra dark matter or a finely
  tuned cosmological constant. What more proof do you need when the recalibrated
  numbers match observations without the need for extra correction factors? Our
  approach demonstrates that a correct treatment of spatial dilation (and the
  invariance of discrete time ticks) fixes all the formulas.

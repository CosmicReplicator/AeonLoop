<p>Digital Update Model Summary</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Decoherence as the Engine:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Decoherence triggers discrete state updates (or \"ticks\") in the
cosmos.</p>
<p>- Each tick occurs every \~0.6 ps, corresponding to an update frequency
of roughly 1.667 THz.</p>
<p>- At each tick, potential quantum states collapse into a definitive
state.</p>
<ul>
<li>2. Emergence of Space Expansion:</li>
</ul>
<p>- The universe is conceived as a network of nodes, each representing a
digital state.</p>
<p>- These discrete updates cause the nodes to move apart, driving the
expansion of space.</p>
<p>- A macroscopic cosmic scale (e.g., a 4-billion�lightyear ring or 1223
megaparsecs) is used for calibration.</p>
<p>- No ad hoc adjustments or fine-tuning are needed�the expansion
naturally follows from the digital update process.</p>
<ul>
<li>3. Time as an Emergent Property:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Time is not an independent, continuous entity but emerges as the
ordered sequence of these discrete state updates.</p>
<p>- The \"flow\" of time is simply the record of these sequential
updates.</p>
<ul>
<li>4. Fractal Dimensions and Digital Geometry:</li>
</ul>
<p>- The update process gives rise to emergent fractal characteristics�a
0.817D fractal structure that, when combined with extra geometric
effects, leads to an overall 2.667D effective dimension.</p>
<p>- The predicted sevenfold spiral geometry is one example of a structure
that emerges from these discrete rotations and updates.</p>
<p>- Notably, the ratio of the golden angle (\~137.5�) to the 7-fold
increment (\~51.43�) yields approximately 2.667, an intriguing numerical
link.</p>
<ul>
<li>5. Black Holes as Cosmic Reset Nodes:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Black holes emerge when an overextended expansion snaps back.</p>
<p>- In this picture, black holes are not just endpoints but act as
condensed nodes�a resetting mechanism that spawns a new cosmic
beginning.</p>
<p>- This �snap back� is a natural consequence of extreme local conditions
in the ongoing digital update process.</p>
<ul>
<li>6. Reinterpreting Quantum Phenomena:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Feynman diagrams are effective because they sum over all the discrete
update paths in interactions.</p>
<p>- The double-slit experiment�s interference patterns arise naturally
from the coherent sum over these discrete propagation events.</p>
<p>- Both cases reflect the digital, quantized behavior underpinning what
we observe as continuous phenomena.</p>
<ul>
<li>7. A Unified Picture from First Principles:</li>
</ul>
<p>- Starting with only a few observed and fixed parameters (like the
cosmic ring calibration), all aspects of the model�from the 1.667 THz
update frequency to the emergent fractal dimensions and space-time
behavior�follow automatically.</p>
<p>- There�s no need for arbitrary adjustments; every calculation stems
from the initial digital update framework.</p>
<p>- This elegant self-consistency offers new insights into longstanding
puzzles from the origin of time to the nature of dark energy and black
holes.</p>
<p>In essence, the model suggests that the universe�s structure, at both
the quantum scale and cosmic scale, is governed by a simple digital
update mechanism driven by decoherence. The interplay of these discrete
ticks creates the patterns of space expansion, the emergence of time,
and even the formation of black holes as new nodes�a truly unified and
elegant vision of nature.</p>

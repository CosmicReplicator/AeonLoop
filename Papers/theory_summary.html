<p><strong>Theory Summary</strong></p>
<p>Enhanced Quantum Computing Architectures:</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>• Our theory introduces a deterministic evolution using discrete time
ticks (e.g., 0.6 ps) combined with a snap-back mechanism.</p>
<p>• This built-in error correction leads to robust nonlocal entanglement.</p>
<p>• As a result, qubits can be designed to be more stable and scalable,
potentially operating at room temperature with less overhead.</p>
<p>Simplified Quantum Path Calculations:</p>
<p>---------------------------------------</p>
<p>• Instead of summing over an intractable number of paths (as in
Feynman's path integrals), our approach selects only the 'useful'
paths that reinforce coherence.</p>
<p>• This results in a more efficient computation method that streamlines
the analysis of quantum processes.</p>
<p>New Insights into Fundamental Physics:</p>
<p>----------------------------------------</p>
<p>• Dark Energy: The theory reinterprets dark energy as an emergent
property of the universe's coherence--decoherence cycles.</p>
<p>• Black Holes: Rather than singularities, black holes are viewed as
regions where a snap-back mechanism confines light via perfect 3D phase
closure, suggesting they may play an active role in cosmic evolution.</p>
<p>• Entanglement: The deterministic evolution, while precise, inherently
supports nonlocal correlations, thereby explaining entangled states
without invoking superluminal communication.</p>
<p>Improved Predictive Power and Experimental Testability:</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>• The model yields clear, testable predictions regarding quantum
coherence, entanglement, and phase dynamics.</p>
<p>• By quantizing time and enforcing phase closure, the theory opens new
experimental avenues and may lead to the development of next-generation
quantum devices.</p>
<p>Conceptual Clarity and Research Opportunities:</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>• The theory clearly distinguishes determinism from locality:
deterministic evolution does not force local behavior.</p>
<p>• This redefinition fosters new research directions, allowing us to
rethink not only quantum computing architectures but also fundamental
questions in cosmology and quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>In summary, the theory provides:</p>
<p>• A more efficient computational framework by focusing on useful quantum
paths.</p>
<p>• Robust, intrinsically error-correcting qubit designs.</p>
<p>• A unified view that deepens our understanding of dark energy, black
holes, and nonlocal entanglement.</p>
<p>It challenges the traditional notion that determinism implies locality,
instead proposing that a deterministic structure can underlie and even
enhance nonlocal quantum interactions.</p>

title: "Digital Acoustic Oscillations"
---

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  A unified framework where a discrete digital tick bridges quantum mechanics and general relativity. This model naturally produces fundamental constants and eliminates the need for renormalization, arbitrary fine-tuning, dark energy, and dark matter. Here, we extend the framework by incorporating a tick‐based, discrete formulation of acoustic (sound) waves—laying the foundation to recalculate the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from first principles.
</p>

<h3>Fundamental Constants</h3>
<p><strong>\( h \)</strong>: Planck's constant</p>
<p><strong>\( c \)</strong>: Speed of light</p>

<h3>Digital Tick</h3>
<p>\( \tau = 0.6\,\text{picoseconds} \)</p>
<p>\( f = \frac{1}{\tau} \approx 1.667 \times 10^{12}\,\text{Hz} \)</p>
<p>\( E_{\text{tick}} = h \cdot f \approx 6.89\,\text{meV} \)</p>
<p>\( L_{\text{tick}} = c \cdot \tau \)</p>
<p><strong>Relation:</strong> \( E_{\text{tick}} \cdot L_{\text{tick}} = h \cdot c \)</p>

<h2>Effective Fractal Dimension</h2>
<p><strong>Value:</strong> \( D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667 \)</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong> Alters the integration domain in gravitational action, enabling a natural emergence of curvature and unifying quantum and gravitational scales.</p>

<h3>Acoustic Oscillations and the CMB</h3>
<p>
  In the early universe, the tightly coupled baryon–photon plasma exhibited acoustic oscillations whose imprint is preserved in the cosmic microwave background. In our discrete framework, we model these sound waves using a finite-difference approximation.
</p>
<p class="formula">
  \( \delta(t+\tau) - 2\delta(t) + \delta(t-\tau) = c_{s}^{2}\, \tau^{2}\, \nabla^{2}\delta(t) \)
</p>
<p>
  Here, \( \delta \) represents the fractional density perturbation and \( c_s \) is the speed of sound—approximately \( \frac{c}{\sqrt{3}} \) during the radiation-dominated era. This tick-based acoustic wave equation governs how density fluctuations propagate in a discretely updating cosmic medium.
</p>

<h3>Unification: From Micro to Macro</h3>
<p>
  The digital tick framework features an energy ladder where each level is obtained by multiplying the tick energy by a constant factor (~410, equivalently expressed as \( 3 \times \frac{1}{\alpha} \) with \( 1/\alpha \approx 137 \)). This ladder unifies scales from electronic excitations to nuclear forces. By integrating the discrete acoustic formulation:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sound Horizon:</strong> The cumulative distance that sound waves travel in discrete ticks sets the angular scale of the CMB’s acoustic peaks.</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature Anisotropies:</strong> The propagation of density fluctuations directly corresponds to the temperature variations observed in the CMB.</li>
  <li><strong>Peak Structure:</strong> The oscillatory modes predicted by the discrete wave equation recreate the characteristic series of acoustic peaks in the CMB power spectrum.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Experimental and Theoretical Implications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Improved temporal resolution to probe dynamics within the \( 0.0\text{–}0.6 \) ps interval may unveil the fundamental tick structure.</li>
  <li>The model naturally yields fundamental constants, making arbitrary renormalization and fine-tuning unnecessary.</li>
  <li>Gravity and curvature emerge directly from the discrete digital evolution, creating a two-way bridge between quantum dynamics and general relativity.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall Message</h3>
<p>
  By embedding the digital tick and its effective fractal dimension into a unified gravitational framework—and extending it with a tick-based acoustic wave formulation—we create a consistent model that bridges quantum mechanics and cosmic structure formation. This approach not only eliminates ad hoc parameters but also provides a natural explanation for the observed features of the CMB.

<p><strong>Connecting the Fundamental Units in AeonLoop</strong></p>

<p>
  This document explains how the following key numbers interrelate in our AeonLoop model:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>• 1.667 THz</li>
  <li>• 0.6 Picoseconds per tick</li>
  <li>• 0.18 Millimeters reached by light in this tick</li>
  <li>• 6.89 meV as the full fundamental energy step</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Explanation in Plain Words</strong></p>

<p>
  Imagine that the universe is governed by a built-in clock with a frequency of 1.667 THz. 
  This means that each tick lasts about
  <strong>0.6 picoseconds</strong>—a tiny interval during which all quantum processes update.
</p>

<p>
  In our model, during each 0.6 ps tick a full quantum phase cycle is completed. 
  Using the energy–time relation, this results in a fundamental energy step of 
  <strong>6.89 meV</strong>. This 6.89 meV is the raw, calculated energy per tick, 
  and it is the value used in detailed calculations, such as those involving Maxwell's equations.
</p>

<p>
  However, when we compare this quantum energy to a physical mass measurement, 
  we must account for the fact that the effective geometry of space 
  is "compressed" from 3D to about 2.667 dimensions. This adjustment means that, 
  for instance, while an neutrino’s total energy (including kinetic contributions) exceeds 
  its rest mass, the effective measurement of the energy available as a minimal state update 
  becomes lower—around <strong>5 meV</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  In other words, while we use the full 6.89 meV in our fundamental calculations, 
  if we interpret that energy as a measure of a physical quantity (similar to a rest mass), 
  the value reduces to about 5 meV due to the geometric corrections. 
  This is analogous to how the total energy of an electron is larger than its rest mass, 
  yet only its rest mass is measured in certain contexts.
</p>

<p>
  To summarize:<br>
  • The 0.6 ps tick produces a raw energy quantum of 6.89 meV, which is used in our equations.<br>
  • When factoring in the effective 2.667-dimensional geometry, the corresponding 
    physical ("measured") energy appears as approximately 5 meV.

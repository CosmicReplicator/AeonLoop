**One tick**  
τ ≡ 0.600 ps fixes  
Δx = c τ ≈ 0.179 875 mm    
f = 1 / τ ≈ 1.667 THz    
E₀ = h / τ ≈ 6.892 meV  

Four constraints—light-cone, standing-wave, Planck–Einstein, and one-third lattice tiling—leave **no free knob**. Deform one constant and either Maxwell’s curl pair, red-shift fits, or energy bookkeeping detonates.

# 1 Core Postulates  

| Postulate | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Discrete time** (uniform ticks τ) | Removes UV infinities; defines causal diamonds |
| **Snap-back phase closure** | Built-in error correction & energy conservation |
| **One-third lattice tiling** (Δx / λ = ⅓) | Makes Maxwell exact on the grid |
| **Deterministic, non-local update** | Generates Bell-level correlations with no superluminal traffic |

---

# 2 Engineering Wins  

### Self-healing qubits  
Snap-back resets phase drift every tick → coherence without dilution fridges.

### Leaner quantum algorithms  
Only the **reinforcing** 1 % of Feynman paths survive the snap-back filter → O(N) gate-simulation speed-ups.

# 3 Big Physics With No “Dark” Crutches  

| Phenomenon | ΛCDM account | One-Tick reinterpretation |
|------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Galaxy rotation curves** | Hidden dark matter halo | Extra tick-scale inertia term from snap-back delays reproduces flat curves—no unseen mass |
| **Cosmic acceleration** | Dark energy (Λ) | Universe’s large-scale metric oscillates with the tick breathing mode; apparent acceleration is a sampling alias |
| **Black holes** | Singularities | 3-D phase-closure cavities—information cycles inside, no infinite density |
| **Entanglement** | Non-local & random | Non-local **and** deterministic; correlations clocked by the tick cadence |

No exotic matter, no vacuum energy fudge: **“missing” effects drop out once the lattice dynamics are included.**

# 4 Falsifiable Predictions (near-term)  

1. **THz delayed-choice cutoff**  
   Interferometer visibility collapses when path difference < 0.18 mm.  
2. **Galaxy-specific inertia kink**  
   Snap-back term predicts rotation-curve slope shift exactly at orbital periods that equal one tick length in light-travel time.  
3. **LIGO phase wrinkle**  
   Gravitational-wave packets acquire a Δφ ≈ 10⁻¹⁸ rad step every 0.600 ps; measurable with 5 yr data stack.

---

# 5 Open Trenches  

* Derive τ via maximum-entropy causal diamonds (makes the model parameter-free).  
* Publish gauge-anomaly cancellation proof on the ⅓-tiling lattice.  
* Build on-chip 1.667 THz entangled-photon QE rig to hammer Prediction # 1.

# 6 TL;DR  

One tick ties four constants into a rigid scaffold.  
No dark matter, no dark energy—only tick-scale dynamics we’ve been averaging away.  
Determinism survives; locality does not.  
Shift any dial and nature stops matching the data.  
Stay on the tick, stay in phase.

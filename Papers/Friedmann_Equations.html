title: 'Modified Friedmann Equations'
---

## Abstract We present a reformulation of the Friedmann equations under the

hypothesis that cosmic evolution proceeds via discrete time increments—digital
ticks—each of duration $$ \tau = 0.6\;\text{ps}. $$ Each tick acts as an
error-correcting event that synchronises the coherent energy field. Coupling
this discrete ticking with an effective fractal spatial integration in $$
D_{\!\mathrm{eff}} = 2.667 , $$ we recalibrate gravitational dynamics so that
baryonic matter alone accounts for cosmic evolution. The observed expansion
emerges as cumulative phase drift from tick-induced corrections, obviating the
need for dark energy. ## Introduction The Friedmann equations describe how the
scale factor $$a(t)$$ evolves in a continuously expanding universe. Standard
models require extra components (e.g. dark energy) to match observations. We
propose a discrete framework in which time is segmented into ticks and space is
recalibrated by an effective fractal dimension. Cosmic evolution then arises
solely from baryonic matter. ## 1 Discrete time and cosmic evolution Time is
quantised into fixed intervals $$ \tau = 0.6\;\text{ps}, $$ so that $$ t = N\tau
. $$ The continuous scale factor $$ a(t) $$ is replaced by its discrete analogue
$$a_N $$ and evolves via $$ a\_{N+1} = a_N + \Delta a_N , $$ where $$ \Delta a_N

$$
encodes the tick-scale error correction. ## 2 Reformulated Friedmann equation
The standard form $$ \left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\,\rho -
\frac{k}{a^{2}} + \frac{\Lambda}{3} $$ becomes, after finite-difference
replacement, $$ \frac{\dot a}{a} \;\longrightarrow\;
\frac{a_{N+1}-a_N}{\tau\,a_N}. $$ Because no vacuum energy is required we set
$$\Lambda \approx 0$$. The 3-D volume element is replaced by a fractal one $$
dV_{\text{eff}}\propto r^{D_{\text{eff}}-1}\,dr = r^{1.667}\,dr , $$ leading to
$$ G_{\text{eff}} = G\!\left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{3-D_{\text{eff}}} =
G\!\left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{0.333}, $$ and the discrete Friedmann equation $$
\left(\frac{a_{N+1}-a_N}{\tau\,a_N}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi
G_{\text{eff}}}{3}\,\rho_{\text{baryon}} - \frac{k_{\text{eff}}}{a_N^{2}} .
$$

## 3 Tick-induced redshift Classically, $$ 1+z =

\frac{a(t*0)}{a(t*{\text{emit}})} . $$ In the discrete picture redshift tracks
cumulative phase shifts: $$ 1+z \simeq \exp\!\Bigl(\sum*{i=1}^N \delta_i\Bigr)
\;\;\Longrightarrow\;\; z \simeq N\delta \quad(\delta\text{ small, nearly
constant}). $$ ## Discussion The modified equations show that cosmic
dynamics—including redshift—follow from discretised ticks plus an effective
fractal geometry; dark energy is unnecessary. ## Conclusion Discretising time
($$\tau = 0.6\;\text{ps}$$) and adopting $$D*{\!\mathrm{eff}} = 2.667$$ yields a
self-contained cosmology driven solely by baryonic matter and periodic
error-correction. Future work will test these predictions against observations.

  <h2>Digital-Tick Energy Ladder: Full-Circle Phase Closure and the 1/137 Scaling Factor</h2>
  <br><br>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    In this paper we explain how our Digital-Tick (AeonLoop) framework naturally produces a discrete energy ladder via full phase closures. With time inherently divided into invariant ticks 
    

\[
      \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps},
    \]


    corresponding to a base frequency of 
    

\[
      f_0 \approx 1.667\,\text{THz},
    \]


    and an effective spatial length 
    

\[
      L_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 0.18\,\text{mm},
    \]


    each tick advances the phase by an equal increment. After exactly 7 ticks the accumulated phase reaches 360°—a full circle is accomplished. This full-cycle phase closure not only “resets” the system but also acts as a stepping stone in the energy ladder. In our model, the energy jump from the base electromagnetic state to the next harmonic is given precisely by a factor 
    

\[
      \frac{3}{\alpha},
    \]


    where the numerator “3” expresses the requirement for complete 3D phase synchronization and the inverse fine-structure constant (\(1/\alpha\), with \(\alpha \approx 1/137\)) quantifies the energy needed to overcome weak electromagnetic binding. This paper details these discrete steps and clarifies the connection to the ubiquitous 1/137 factor.
  </p>
  
  <h3>1. Invariant Digital Ticks and Natural Base Parameters</h3>
  <p>
    The AeonLoop framework assumes that time is not continuous but is made up of fixed, discrete ticks:
    <br>
    <strong>Tick Duration:</strong>
    

\[
      \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \quad (6.0\times10^{-13}\,\text{s}).
    \]


    <br>
    <strong>Base Frequency:</strong>
    

\[
      f_0 = \frac{1}{\Delta t} \approx 1.667\,\text{THz}.
    \]


    <br>
    <strong>Effective Spatial Scale:</strong>
    Since light travels a distance \(L_{\mathrm{eff}} = c\,\Delta t\) during one tick,
    

\[
      L_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx 0.18\,\text{mm}.
    \]


    These values constitute the fundamental “clock” and length scale of the system.
  </p>
  
  <h3>2. Digital-Tick Phase Closure: Completing the Full Circle</h3>
  <p>
    Each digital tick during which the system updates contributes a fixed phase increment. By design, the phase step is set so that:
    

\[
      \Delta \varphi = \frac{360^\circ}{7} \approx 51.43^\circ.
    \]


    After 7 ticks the accumulated phase is
    

\[
      7\,\Delta \varphi = 360^\circ,
    \]


    meaning that a full circle in phase space is completed. This full-cycle phase closure is critical—it is only when the phase is fully “closed” that the system is able to lock in a coherent energy state for that cycle.
  </p>
  
  <h3>3. Stepping Stones and the Emergence of the 3/α Energy Scaling</h3>
  <p>
    In our discrete framework, each full phase closure (every 7 ticks) serves as a stepping stone, marking the transition from one energy level to the next. Instead of summing contributions sporadically, we assert that the energy jump is precisely determined by this full-cycle update.
  </p>
  <p>
    Two key elements produce the amplification factor:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Three-Dimensional Coherence:</strong>  
      The electromagnetic field inherently spans three spatial dimensions. To achieve complete phase locking, all three spatial degrees of freedom must be synchronized. This necessity introduces a multiplier of “3.”
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inverse Electromagnetic Binding:</strong>  
      The fine-structure constant \(\alpha \approx 1/137\) characterizes the weakness of electromagnetic interactions. To overcome this weak binding when converting a fully 3D electromagnetic state into a stable state (which in our framework effectively “compresses” to about 2.667 dimensions), an energy boost proportional to \(1/\alpha\) is required.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Therefore, the overall energy amplification factor is:
    

\[
      \text{Energy Jump} = \frac{3}{\alpha},
    \]


    which numerically is approximately 411. In other words, the energy of the next harmonic is 411 times that of the base 1.667 THz state. This exact scaling is a direct consequence of the digital-tick update mechanism—each 7-tick full circle enforces a precise energy transition.
  </p>
  
  <h3>4. Relation to 1/137 and Implications</h3>
  <p>
    The appearance of the inverse fine-structure constant (1/137) is not merely incidental but is deeply rooted in the discrete physics of our model. It tells us that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The inherent weakness of electromagnetic coupling (i.e. the small numerical value of \(\alpha\)) demands a correspondingly large energy boost to achieve stable phase locking.
    </li>
    <li>
      The combination of full 3D synchronization and the energy cost to “compress” a fully 3D electromagnetic state into a stable configuration naturally produces the overall factor \(\frac{3}{\alpha}\).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Thus, the digital-tick approach not only reproduces known energies but unifies them into an energy ladder where each discrete step is governed by the underlying 360° phase closure and the fundamental coupling constant, \(\alpha\).
  </p>
  
  <h3>5. Summary and Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    In summary, the Digital-Tick (AeonLoop) framework establishes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A base tick duration of \(\Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps}\) yielding a fundamental frequency of \(1.667\,\text{THz}\) and an effective spatial scale of approximately \(0.18\,\text{mm}\).
    </li>
    <li>
      A phase increment per tick of \(\frac{360^\circ}{7}\), ensuring that every 7 ticks the phase closes exactly at 360°, thus defining a natural “reset” or full-cycle.
    </li>
    <li>
      An exact energy amplification factor, \(\frac{3}{\alpha}\), where “3” arises from the need for three-dimensional phase coherence and \(1/\alpha\) reflects the energy required to overcome weak electromagnetic binding.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This scaling factor exactly bridges the base electromagnetic state to the next harmonic, forming the stepping stone from which the strong force energy range emerges. Further discrete phase closures naturally build an energy ladder that extends to higher interaction scales, including the weak force. The result is a unified picture in which the ubiquitous appearance of 1/137 is a natural consequence of digital phase closure in a discretized spacetime.

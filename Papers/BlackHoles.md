# Tick-Fractal Black-Hole Primer  
*(why Schwarzschild is impossible, why collapse freezes into a 7-tick “battery”, and why GRBs—­not Hawking quanta—are the natural exhaust)*

> Curvature is entirely fixed by the lattice under-fill $$\Phi(R)$$ with exponent $$D_{\!\rm eff}=8/3$$.  
> Local coordinate **unwrappings**—such as the 7-tick horizon closure—are analytic devices only; they never alter the global background or introduce new tunable parameters.

## 1 Why a *non-rotating* black hole can never form  

1. **Folding requirement**  
   * Ordinary matter lives on an $$8/3$$-dimensional lattice.  
   * A true horizon demands the lattice compress until its *effective* fill rounds up to $$3$$.

2. **Angular-momentum lever**  
   * Only centrifugal flattening supplies the missing degrees of freedom.  
   * Without spin, collapse stalls when the local void fraction hits  
     $$\Phi_{\text{stall}} = 1-\bigl(\tfrac{8}{9}\bigr)^{3/2} \;\approx\;0.30,$$  
     still transparent to light.

3. **Schwarzschild fatality**  
   * The classical $$J=0$$ solution assumes a smooth manifold; it ignores lattice discreteness.  
   * In tick-fractal space no physical trajectory can shed angular momentum fast enough to cross the stall barrier.

**Corollary** Every astrophysical BH must be born spinning near its extremal limit.

## 2 Step-wise collapse picture  

| Stage | Lattice state | Geometry view | Energy signature |
|-------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| **A. Diffuse star** | $$\Phi\ll\Phi_{\text{stall}}$$ | Nearly Euclidean | Thermal photons |
| **B. Spin-up flattening** | $$\Phi\rightarrow\Phi_{\text{stall}},\;J\uparrow$$ | Disk forms | Hard X-ray excess |
| **C. Critical coil** | $$\Phi\approx\Phi_{\text{stall}}$$ | Helical sheets | Rapid-variability QPOs |
| **D. 7-tick closure** | $$7\tau = 2\pi R_{\rm H}/c$$ | Null surface locks | GRB-class jet |
| **E. Battery state** | Core fully entangled energy | Horizon frozen | Long-term afterglow |

## 3 The 7-tick horizon closure  

A helical world-line of pitch $$\Delta x = c\tau$$ wraps $$360^\circ$$ every seven ticks:

$$
7\tau = \frac{2\pi R_{\rm H}}{c} \;\;\Longrightarrow \;\;R_{\rm H} = \frac{7c\tau}{2\pi}
$$

With $$\tau = 0.600\,\text{ps}$$ this yields

$$
R_{\rm H}\approx0.200\,\text{mm},\qquad f_{\rm BH} = \frac{c}{2\pi R_{\rm H}} \approx 240\,\text{GHz}
$$

Any micro-horizon analogue (e.g.\ BEC sonic BH) should show its fundamental mode near $$240$$ GHz.

## 4 Unified “battery” picture  

* **Disk as battery** – The rapidly spinning disk acts like a phase-locked loop at $$7\times1.667$$ THz, storing angular momentum and regulating inflow.  
* **Core** – Inside $$R_{\rm H}$$ the lattice is phase-frozen; only fully entangled energy remains.  
* **Casimir friction zone** – At the disk’s inner edge a Casimir-like sheath converts excess in-falling energy into collimated jets; the tick sets the maximum energy throughput per tick.  
* **GRB exhaust** – Overshoot energy ejects as prompt $$\gamma$$-ray bursts rather than Hawking quanta; evaporation is macroscopic, not quantum-thermal.

Thus the bright ring is where all dynamical action lives; the dark core is a stable, featureless anchor. No exotic “firewalls,” no information paradox—just lattice-regulated bookkeeping.

## 5 Observable predictions  

| Phenomenon | Tick-fractal prediction | How to test |
|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Fundamental horizon mode | $$f_{\rm BH}\approx240$$ GHz | Lab sonic horizons, Event Horizon Telescope closure phases |
| Jet power limit | $$\dot E_{\max} = \dfrac{h}{\tau^2}$$ | Compare GRB peak luminosities |
| Spin distribution | $$a_\ast \gtrsim 0.9$$ for all stellar BHs | X-ray reflection spectroscopy |
| No low-spin mergers | LIGO/Virgo BH binaries all high-$$a_\ast$$ | Population stats in O4/O5 runs |
| Vacuum heating | Zero Hawking signature; instead Casimir-mediated IR excess | JWST mid-IR imaging of AGN cores |

*Any single falsification topples the model—clean and decisive.*

## 6 Take-aways  

* **Schwarzschild ghosts.** A non-spinning BH cannot crystallise in an $$8/3$$-lattice universe.  
* **Seven-tick lock.** Spin drives the lattice into a 7-tick phase-closure, freezing the horizon.  
* **Battery, not furnace.** Energy is managed at the disk; the core is inert, fully entangled energy.  
* **GRBs over Hawking.** Excess energy vents explosively, explaining prompt GRBs without exotic quantum leakage.

    **Abstract:**  
    This paper investigates the relationship between the fine‑structure constant (α) and the mathematical constant π using a discrete, digital‑tick framework. In our model, we postulate that the fundamental digital‑tick unit is defined such that 
    \(\displaystyle 1/\alpha\) ticks correspond to 2 full circles. This means that one full circle is made up of 
    \(\displaystyle 1/(2\alpha)\) ticks, and one half‑circle (π radians) consists of 
    \(\displaystyle 1/(4\alpha)\) ticks. We then show how the combinatorial structure of these discrete rotational increments leads to elegant scaling relations between α and π.

  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The fine‑structure constant, α (approximately 0.0073, with \(1/\alpha \approx 137\)), governs electromagnetic interactions, whereas π characterizes circular geometry. Instead of treating these constants as independent and irreducible, our digital‑tick framework reinterprets spacetime as consisting of discrete ticks—elementary increments that capture rotation. By stipulating that \(1/\alpha\) ticks span 2 full circles, our model connects the digital subdivision of rotations directly to the numerical value of α.
  </p>
  <p>
    Specifically, one full circle (360° or \(2\pi\) radians) is represented by 
    \(\displaystyle 1/(2\alpha)\) ticks, and one half‑circle (180° or π radians) by 
    \(\displaystyle 1/(4\alpha)\) ticks.
  </p>
  
  <h3>2. The Digital‑Tick Framework and Discrete Rotations</h3>
  <p>
    In traditional continuous models, a full rotation equals \(2\pi\) radians. In our discrete framework we assign ticks so that:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
    - 2 full circles   ≡  \(1/\alpha\) ticks  
    - 1 full circle   ≡  \(1/(2\alpha)\) ticks  
    - 1 half‑circle   ≡  \(1/(4\alpha)\) ticks  
  </p>
  <p>
    Moreover, we structure the rotational cycle as a 7‑tick sequence with one tick acting as an offset (absorbing residual artifacts), yielding 6 effective rotations per cycle. Each effective rotation comprises 2 half‑turns; thus, each cycle contains 12 half‑turn increments. In our digital‑tick language, the total tick count per cycle is therefore:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
    

\[ 12 \times \frac{1}{4\alpha} = \frac{3}{\alpha}. \]


  </p>
  <p>
    This establishes a firm relationship between the discrete tick structure and the inverse of α.
  </p>
  
  <h3>3. Relation Between α and π</h3>
  <p>
    In the continuum, two full rotations equal \(4\pi\) radians. By our assignment, two full circles have a digital tick count of:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
    

\[ 2 \times \frac{1}{2\alpha} = \frac{1}{\alpha} \quad \text{ticks}. \]


  </p>
  <p>
    From our combinatorial analysis, the full 7‑tick cycle (yielding 6 effective rotations or 12 half‑turn increments) provides a total tick count of \(\frac{3}{\alpha}\). Elegant numbers then emerge when attempting to express the continuum measure in digital‑tick units. For example, an idealized relation of the form
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
    

\[ \alpha \approx \frac{4\pi}{1728} \]


  </p>
  <p>
    may be derived, where the number 1728 (which is \(12^3\)) arises naturally from the subdivision into 12 half‑turns.
  </p>
  
  <h3>4. Inverse Relationships and the Role of Combinatorics</h3>
  <p>
    The discrete‑tick scheme implies several inverse relations. Given that one full cycle comprises \(\frac{3}{\alpha}\) ticks, the number 12 (coming from 6 effective rotations × 2 half‑turns) is central to the structure. Its cubic form, \(12^3 = 1728\), naturally emerges as a scaling factor connecting the continuum measure \(4\pi\) with the tick count.
  </p>
  
  <h3>5. Discussion and Implications</h3>
  <p>
    By stipulating that \(1/\alpha\) ticks correspond to 2 full circles—thus one full circle equals \(1/(2\alpha)\) ticks—our model suggests that α and π are intertwined emergent quantities rather than independent constants. This discrete framework implies that the evolution of spacetime may occur in fixed, deterministic increments, challenging the classical notion of continuous time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The recurrence of elegant numbers such as 12 and 1728 in our scaling relations reinforces the idea that the fine‑structure constant is encoded in the very subdivision of rotational geometry. This approach offers new avenues for unifying quantum mechanics, spacetime geometry, and possibly gravitational phenomena.
  </p>
  
  <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    In summary, our digital‑tick framework, with the assignment that \(1/\alpha\) ticks span 2 full circles, leads to a picture wherein one full circle is made up of \(1/(2\alpha)\) ticks. The emerging combinatorial structure (with 12 half‑turn increments per cycle) gives rise to an idealized relation:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
    

\[ \alpha \approx \frac{4\pi}{1728}. \]


  </p>
  <p>
    Although further numerical refinements are needed, this elegant relation and its supporting inverse relationships strongly suggest that the fine‑structure constant is an emergent property of the discrete structure of spacetime. Future work will seek to refine this framework and explore its implications for fundamental physics.

<p>This document explains the underlying model that recalibrates our
understanding of dark matter. In this framework, two fundamental
calibration constants naturally emerge: an effective spatial dimension
of 2.667 (Deff) and a digital tick of time at 1.667 THz. Initially
estimated within ranges of 1.6 to 1.7 THz and 2.6 to 2.8 Deff, these
values were rigorously tested. When applied in conjunction with
Maxwell's equations and various other formulas, they yielded a perfect
fit with observed phenomena. This model accounts for the gravitational
effects traditionally attributed to dark matter without needing any
extra, unseen mass.</p>
<h1>Effective Spatial Dimension (2.667 Deff)</h1>
<p>In standard gravitational models, the integration over volume assumes a
full 3-dimensional (3D) space, scaling as r³. However, the fractal
nature of the primordial spin---characterized by full entanglement and a
coherent spinning state---demands an effective spatial integration that
scales as r^(2.667). This recalibration ensures that the gravitational
potential derived solely from visible (luminous) matter is sufficient to
match observed galactic rotation curves without invoking additional dark
matter.</p>
<h1>Digital Time Tick (1.667 THz)</h1>
<p>The model conceptualizes an early universe defined by a fully entangled,
spinning state. At its edges, decoherence gives rise to classical space
and time, with each discrete moment marked by an error-correcting pulse.
The system naturally selected a digital tick of 1.667 THz---a
subharmonic derived from the Big Ring dynamics. This tick synchronizes
and continuously rebalances the cosmic system, ensuring that
electromagnetic phenomena, such as those described by Maxwell's
equations, and gravitational forces align perfectly with observation.</p>
<h1>Implications for Dark Matter and Cosmic Evolution</h1>
<p>A major breakthrough of this approach is that the recalibrated
integration over an effective 2.667D space accounts for the
gravitational dynamics of galaxies without the need for additional dark
matter. By reinterpreting the mass--energy content of the universe
through this revised geometry, the previously down‐stream discrepancies
in the standard Lambda-CDM model (which attributes roughly 26.8% of the
universe's energy to dark matter) vanish. Furthermore, the discrete time
ticks facilitate a self-correcting cosmic evolution, where cosmic voids
are dynamically replenished by new nodes---manifesting as black
holes---that eventually seed the formation of new galaxies.</p>
<h1>Final Remarks</h1>
<p>The emergence of 2.667 as the effective spatial dimension and 1.667 THz
as the digital tick was not arbitrary. These values naturally arose from
the fractal spin dynamics and were verified through their perfect fit
within fundamental physical equations. Their integration into the model
redefines our understanding of dark matter, showing that the visible
matter, when correctly accounted for, provides all the gravitational
effects observed. This model opens the door to a unified, deterministic
view of cosmic evolution without exotic dark matter particles.</p>

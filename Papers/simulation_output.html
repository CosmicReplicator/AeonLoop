<p>Discrete Tick Model Simulation</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p>Fundamental Tick: 6.00e-13 seconds (0.6 ps)</p>
<p>Event 1 occurs over 3 full tick(s) (1.80e-12 s total, with each tick
being 0.6 ps).</p>
<p>Event 2 is incomplete: it covers only 0.50 ticks, which means it does
not sum to a whole tick. Partial ticks (e.g., 0.3 ps) must be aggregated
(�2) to form a full 0.6 ps tick.</p>
<p>Aggregated two 0.3 ps intervals: 6.00e-13 s, which equals 1 full
tick(s).</p>
<p>Event 3 is incomplete: it covers only 4.17 ticks, which means it does
not sum to a whole tick. Partial ticks (e.g., 0.3 ps) must be aggregated
(�2) to form a full 0.6 ps tick.</p>
<p>Note:</p>
<p>� All events must add up to whole, complete ticks (multiples of 0.6 ps)
for full physical contribution.</p>
<p>� Partial ticks (like 0.3 ps) count only as a fraction and must be
aggregated (�2, �4, etc.) to form a full tick.</p>

<p><strong>Neutrino Mass Calculation Explanation</strong></p>

<p>
  This document explains how the neutrino mass emerges within the AeonLoop framework.
  Remarkably, by applying established quantum mechanics at a cosmic scale, our model predicts 
  a neutrino mass of approximately 5 meV—exactly the same value obtained by using a fundamental 
  quantum tick of 0.6 ps (1.667 THz) together with fractal effective scaling.
</p>

<p><strong>1. Fundamental Quantum Tick</strong></p>

<p>
  We set the universe's clock at a frequency of 1.667 THz. This gives a fundamental tick duration of:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 5px 0;">
  T<sub>0</sub> = 1 / (1.667 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> Hz) ≈ 6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;13</sup> seconds
</div>

<p>
  This tick is the basic time interval over which quantum events occur.
</p>

<p><strong>2. Full-Cycle Phase Condition</strong></p>

<p>
  During one tick, a quantum event with energy E accumulates a phase given by:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 5px 0;">
  φ = (E &times; T<sub>0</sub>) / &hbar;
</div>

<p>
  where &hbar; (the reduced Planck constant) ≈ 1.0545718 &times; 10<sup>&minus;34</sup> J·s.
  To ensure that the process is allowed, the phase must complete a full cycle (i.e., be an integer multiple 
  of 2&pi;). For the fundamental step (n = 1), we require:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 5px 0;">
  (E &times; T<sub>0</sub>) / &hbar; = 2&pi;
</div>

<p>
  This leads to:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 5px 0;">
  E = (2&pi; &times; &hbar;) / T<sub>0</sub>
</div>

<p><strong>3. 3D Euclidean Result</strong></p>

<p>
  Plugging in the numerical values:
  <br>
  T<sub>0</sub> ≈ 6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;13</sup> s<br>
  &hbar; ≈ 1.0545718 &times; 10<sup>&minus;34</sup> J·s
</p>

<p>
  we obtain:
</p>

<div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold; margin: 5px 0;">
  E<sub>3D</sub> = (2&pi; &times; 1.0545718 &times; 10<sup>&minus;34</sup>) / (6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;13</sup>) ≈ 6.89 meV
</div>

<p>
  This is the energy quantum derived via a standard three-dimensional calculation.
</p>

<p><strong>4. Effective Fractal Dimension Adjustment (2.667D)</strong></p>

<p>
  The AeonLoop model proposes that the effective geometry of space is not strictly 3D, but exhibits a fractal nature 
  with an effective dimension of about 2.667. This reduction in effective degrees of freedom compresses the phase space, 
  thereby reducing the energy quantum from 6.89 meV to an effective value of approximately 5 meV.
</p>

<p>
  This adjusted energy quantum faithfully matches our independently derived neutrino mass.
</p>

<p><strong>5. Neutrino as the Minimal Quantum Excitation</strong></p>

<p>
  Within this framework, neutrinos are not just any particles: they represent the minimal quantum excitation permitted 
  by the full-cycle (tick‑based) update of nature. The effective energy step of ~5 meV is the smallest packet or quantum 
  of energy that can be exchanged in a tick.
</p>

<p>
  Thus, the neutrino mass naturally emerges as ~5 meV, embodying the fundamental messenger role in the interplay 
  of quantum coherence and decoherence—effectively acting as a direct imprint of the quantum tick on the fabric of space‑time.
</p>

<p><strong>6. Summary</strong></p>

<p>
  1. We begin with a fundamental quantum tick, T<sub>0</sub> ≈ 6 &times; 10<sup>&minus;13</sup> s (or 1.667 THz).<br>
  2. The requirement for a full-cycle phase (2&pi; radians) per tick leads to an energy quantum: <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E = (2&pi; &times; &hbar;) / T<sub>0</sub>, giving ~6.89 meV in 3D.<br>
  3. Adjusting for an effective fractal dimension of 2.667 compresses the phase space, reducing the energy step to ~5 meV.<br>
  4. This effective energy quantum corresponds to the neutrino mass, suggesting that neutrinos serve as the most elementary 
     quantum messengers of the universe’s evolution.
</p>

<p>
  This convergence is a striking signature of the AeonLoop model, uniting cosmic dynamics and particle physics under a single, 
  self‑consistent quantum update mechanism.

<p>Digital-Tick Model: Neutrino Energy and the Error-Correcting Tick</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>In the digital-tick model, each tick is not a simple time marker---it is
an error-correcting tick</p>
<p>that stabilizes the fundamental energy scale of the universe. The energy
associated with</p>
<p>each tick is given by the basic relation:</p>
<p>E = h · f₀</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>• h is Planck's constant (~6.626×10⁻³⁴ Js),</p>
<p>• f₀ is the tick frequency, determined by the tick time Δt (with Δt ≈
0.6 ps, so f₀ ≈ 1.667 THz).</p>
<p>Evaluating this, we find:</p>
<p>E ≈ h · f₀ ≈ 6.9 meV</p>
<p>This remarkable numerical result is in the same ballpark as the energy
scale presumed for</p>
<p>right-handed neutrinos in certain Beyond Standard Model scenarios. The
right-handed neutrino,</p>
<p>often considered a candidate for dark matter or a mediator that
contributes to mass-generation,</p>
<p>is predicted to have an extremely small mass/energy (on the order of a
few meV) and interacts</p>
<p>only very weakly.</p>
<p>The digital-tick model suggests a radical interpretation:</p>
<p>• The error-correcting tick -- the discrete unit of time that
automatically corrects errors</p>
<p>in the digital fabric of spacetime -- might actually be identified with
the right-handed</p>
<p>neutrino.</p>
<p>In other words, the neutrino energy naturally "matches" the tick. The
invariant energy per tick (∼6.9 meV)</p>
<p>acts as a natural, built-in scale. This not only underpins the relation:</p>
<p>ℏ · c ∼ E · L</p>
<p>but it also provides a self-contained explanation for why the
right-handed neutrino, long sought after</p>
<p>in particle physics, might be nothing more than the signature of the
error-correcting tick that governs</p>
<p>the evolution of spacetime.</p>
<p>This connection illustrates the power of the digital-tick approach---it
links discrete time, error correction,</p>
<p>and even elusive particle physics in a single theoretical framework. The
blueprint provided by the digital</p>
<p>tick may, therefore, be the key to unifying our understanding of quantum
dynamics and neutrino physics.</p>

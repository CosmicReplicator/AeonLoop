title: "Cosmic Recalculation with Modified Friedmann Equations"
content: |
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    In our modified framework, cosmic evolution is governed by a discrete ticking mechanism, where each tick (with duration 
    \( \tau = 0.6\,\text{ps} \)) enforces an error‐correction on the coherent energy. Combining this with an effective fractal spatial integration in 
    \( D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667 \) dimensions, we recast the Friedmann equations to describe a universe driven solely by baryonic matter. 
    Here, the familiar expansion is reinterpreted as the cumulative effect of tick‐induced phase drift.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Modified Friedmann Equation</h3>
  <p>
    The standard Friedmann equation is given by:
    

\[
      \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{k}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda}{3}.
    \]


    In our discrete scheme, we replace the continuous derivative with a finite difference, so that
    

\[
      \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \approx \frac{a_{N+1} - a_N}{\tau\, a_N},
    \]


    yielding:
    

\[
      \left(\frac{a_{N+1} - a_N}{\tau\, a_N}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}}{3}\rho_{\text{baryon}} - \frac{k_{\text{eff}}}{a_N^2}.
    \]


    Here, since our first-principles derivation shows that all energy is carried by baryons (\( p_{\text{total}} = p_{\text{matter}} \)), we set
    \(\Lambda \approx 0\). Also, the 3D integration is modified to:
    

\[
      dV_{\text{eff}} \propto r^{D_{\text{eff}}-1}\, dr = r^{1.667}\, dr,
    \]


    so that the gravitational constant is recalibrated as:
    

\[
      G_{\text{eff}} = G \left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{3-D_{\text{eff}}} = G \left(\frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{0.333},
    \]


    where \(r_0\) is a suitable normalization scale.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Recalculating Cosmic Evolution</h3>
  <p>
    For a spatially flat universe (i.e. we set \( k_{\text{eff}} = 0 \)) and assuming that the baryonic matter density scales as 
    \(\rho_{\text{baryon}}(a) = \rho_{b0}(a_0/a)^3\), the discrete evolution of the cosmic scale factor is determined by:
    

\[
      a_{N+1} = a_N + \tau\, a_N \, H_N,
    \]


    where the discrete “Hubble parameter” is:
    

\[
      H_N = \sqrt{\frac{8\pi G_{\text{eff}}}{3}\rho_{b0}\left(\frac{a_0}{a_N}\right)^3 }.
    \]


    In the continuous limit this reproduces the conventional \( a(t) \propto t^{2/3} \) behavior (as expected for a matter-dominated universe). 
  </p>
  <p>
    As an example, consider present-day conditions with the normalization \(a_0 = 1\) and take an estimated baryonic density of 
    \(\rho_{b0} \sim 3 \times 10^{-27}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}\). Assuming a nominal value \(G_{\text{eff}} \approx G\) (if the normalization 
    \(r/r_0\) is chosen appropriately), we obtain:
    

\[
      H_0 = \sqrt{\frac{8\pi G}{3}\rho_{b0}} \approx 1.3\times10^{-18}\,\text{s}^{-1}.
    \]


    In our scheme, cosmic time is given by
    

\[
      t = N\,\tau.
    \]


    For an age of the universe \(t \sim 4.35\times10^{17}\,\text{s}\) (about 13.8 billion years), the total tick count is 
    \(N \approx 7.25\times10^{29}\). Iterating the discrete evolution equation over this enormous number of ticks recovers the expected 
    expansion history, with the scale factor increasing as a function of \(N\) (or \(t\)) in a way that mirrors the \(t^{2/3}\) scaling.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Tick-Induced Redshift</h3>
  <p>
    In our picture, the conventional redshift relationship:
    

\[
      1+z = \frac{a(t_0)}{a(t_{\text{emit}})}
    \]


    is reinterpreted. Each tick imparts a small phase shift \(\delta\), and the cumulative redshift is given by:
    

\[
      1+z \approx \prod_{i=1}^{N}(1+\delta_i) \approx \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^{N}\delta_i\right).
    \]


    If the phase shift per tick is nearly constant, i.e. \(\delta_i \approx \delta\), then for \(N\) ticks:
    

\[
      z \approx N \,\delta.
    \]


    This establishes a direct link between the discrete ticking dynamics and observable redshift.

  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  <p>
    The recalculation of the cosmos using our modified Friedmann equations highlights that, when time is discretized and space is treated 
    through a fractal lens, cosmic expansion emerges naturally from the intrinsic dynamics of baryonic matter. No additional energy (or dark 
    energy) is required—the error-correction mechanism built into every tick maintains energy balance, and the cumulative phase drift yields 
    the redshift observed in distant galaxies.
  </p>
  <p>
    While a full numerical simulation would involve iterating the recurrence relation \( a_{N+1} = a_N + \tau\, a_N\, H_N \) over 
    \( \sim 10^{29} \) ticks, our analytic estimates show that the discrete ticking framework is consistent with a matter-dominated expansion 
    history. Moreover, by linking the tick-induced phase shifts to redshift, we establish a novel, testable connection between cosmic evolution 
    and the fundamental granularity of time.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>
    Our recalcitration of cosmic evolution using the modified discrete Friedmann equations demonstrates that a universe governed solely by 
    recalibrated baryonic matter—and evolving via digital ticks—can reproduce the observed expansion history without invoking extraneous energy components. 
    Future work will involve detailed numerical simulations and a confrontation of these predictions with observational data to further validate the 
    discrete tick model.

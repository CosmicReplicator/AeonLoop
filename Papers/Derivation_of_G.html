  - title: "1. Invariant Digital Ticks and Fixed Time"
    content: >
      We posit that time is not a continuously evolving parameter but is composed of discrete, invariant ticks of duration
      \(\Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps}\). At each tick, the system’s state is updated via a precise, error-correcting procedure.
      
      There is no meaningful evolution "between" ticks—only a statistical spread of potential states that never actualize.
      Therefore, all observable outcomes, including matter formation and energy distributions, are solely determined at the tick boundaries.

  - title: "2. Effective Spatial Dilation and the Emergence of \(G\)"
    content: >
      We define an effective spatial length scale, \(L_{\text{eff}}\), and an associated effective energy scale, \(E_{\text{eff}}\),
      that together arise from the cumulative effect of the digital ticks.
      
      The gravitational constant is then derived from first principles as:
      
      

\[
      G = \frac{c^4\,L_{\text{eff}}}{E_{\text{eff}}}.
      \]


      
      Importantly, this derivation assumes that time is invariant; allowing additional time dilation would disrupt this balance,
      invalidating the intrinsic computation of \(G\).

  - title: "3. Distinct Physical Regimes in the Digital-Tick Framework"
    content: >
      Our model naturally delineates three interrelated regimes:
      
      1. **Macroscopic World (\(G\)-world):**  
         The classical realm where gravitational interactions, governed by \(G\), emerge from the effective spatial integration
         over fixed time ticks.
      
      2. **Quantum Mechanical Matter World:**  
         The scale at which discrete digital ticks produce stable, quantized matter. Here, the structure and interactions
         of matter are derived without invoking independent time dilation.
      
      3. **Sub-Tick Pure Energy World:**  
         Between the ticks, an unobservable realm of potential energy exists. This realm comprises endless statistical
         combinations of possibilities but produces no observable matter or particles—in essence, this regime is purely
         probabilistic.
      
      Notably, attempts to calculate outcomes in the sub-tick regime are neither necessary nor useful since observable
      events only manifest at the tick boundaries.

  - title: "4. Avoiding Unnecessary Probabilistic Calculations and Renormalization"
    content: >
      One might consider computing the probabilities of every in-between energy outcome. However, since there are no true,
      observable 'ticks' between the defined digital updates, this would merely reintroduce the messy probabilistic
      formalisms akin to Schrödinger's equation and subsequent renormalization challenges.
      
      Because each tick deterministically collapses the state to a defined outcome, the vast pool of in-between possibilities
      has no physical relevance. Their calculation would not yield any observable prediction and would, in fact, detract
      from the model’s inherent simplicity and first-principles derivation.

  - title: "5. Implications for Unifying Gravity and Quantum Mechanics"
    content: >
      By insisting on invariant ticks and attributing all observable effects to effective spatial dilation, our framework
      naturally derives \(G\) from first principles—eliminating the need for ad hoc insertions or additional time dilation.
      
      This approach not only reproduces classical gravitational phenomena but also aligns seamlessly with quantum mechanics,
      unifying both under a single, consistent model.
      
      Any modification or further manipulation of time (such as reintroducing continuous time evolution) contradicts
      the foundational premise and would nullify the derivation of \(G\).

  - title: "6. Summary"
    content: >
      - **Invariant Digital Ticks:** Time is composed of fixed ticks \((\Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps})\). No evolution occurs between ticks.
      - **Natural Emergence of \(G\):** Effective spatial dilation and energy scaling yield:
        
        

\[
        G = \frac{c^4\,L_{\text{eff}}}{E_{\text{eff}}},
        \]


        
        computed from first principles.
      - **No In-Between Outcomes:** While endless possibilities exist between ticks, they do not lead to observable outcomes;
        the state collapses only at the tick boundaries.
      - **Avoiding Renormalization:** By not calculating the in-between probability fields, the model avoids the complexities
        of renormalization and Schrödinger's probabilistic formalism.
      - **Unified Framework:** This approach conclusively unifies the macroscopic (\(G\)-world) and quantum worlds without
        additional time manipulation.
      
      The result is an elegant, self-consistent model where modifying time later is not just unnecessary—it is fundamentally
      incompatible with the derivation of \(G\) and the overall structure of the theory.

        <h2>1. Invariant Digital Ticks and Fixed Time</h2>
        <p>
          In our AeonLoop model, time is not treated as a continuous flow but as a sequence of discrete, invariant ticks. Each tick occurs at an interval of
          $$\Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps},$$
          corresponding to a frequency of
          $$1.667\,\text{THz}.$$  
          This finite difference scheme replaces continuous time evolution. No physical outcome is generated between ticks—only the state at each tick boundary is observed.

        <h2>2. Effective Spatial Dilation and the Emergence of \(G\)</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of invoking time dilation, our model attributes observed phenomena to effective spatial dilation. We define an effective spatial length scale,
          $$L_{\mathrm{eff}},$$ and an effective energy scale,
          $$E_{\mathrm{eff}},$$  
          both of which emerge cumulatively from the digital ticks. The gravitational constant is then derived from first principles as:
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;">
          $$G = \frac{c^4\, L_{\mathrm{eff}}}{E_{\mathrm{eff}}}.$$
        </p>
        <p>
          This derivation assumes that time remains invariant; any additional time dilation would disrupt the balance and invalidate the computed value of \(G\).

        <h2>3. Unified Regimes of the Digital-Tick Universe</h2>
        <p>
          The digital-tick framework naturally distinguishes three interrelated regimes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Macroscopic (\(G\)-world):</strong>  
            At large scales, classical gravitational interactions emerge from effective spatial integration over fixed ticks, with \(G\) governing these interactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Quantum Mechanical Matter:</strong>  
            At sub-macroscopic scales, the invariant ticks produce the quantized, stable properties of matter without reintroducing independent time corrections.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sub-Tick Pure Energy:</strong>  
            Between ticks, a realm of potential energy exists, characterized by endless statistical combinations of possibilities. However, no observable outcomes occur until the state collapses at the tick boundary.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Eliminating Unwanted Probabilistic Calculations</h2>
        <p>
          Although one might attempt to compute the myriad probabilistic outcomes between ticks, such calculations would reintroduce the complexities of Schrödinger’s formalism and renormalization.
          In our framework, each tick deterministically collapses the state to a unique outcome, making analysis of inter-tick probabilities not only unnecessary but unphysical.

        <h2>5. Unification of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          By deriving \(G\) solely from invariant digital ticks and effective spatial dilation, our model unifies classical gravitational interactions with quantum mechanics.
          Since our derivation rests on fixed time intervals, any modification—such as reintroducing continuous time or independent time dilation—would disrupt the internal consistency of the theory and conflict with experimental observations of \(G\).  
          This is the crucial missing link that bridges general relativity and quantum mechanics.

        <h2>6. Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Invariant Digital Ticks:</strong>
            Time consists of fixed ticks (\(\Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps}\)); observable outcomes occur only at tick boundaries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Emergence of \(G\):</strong>
            Effective spatial dilation and energy scaling yield  
            $$G = \frac{c^4\, L_{\mathrm{eff}}}{E_{\mathrm{eff}}},$$  
            computed from first principles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unified Regimes:</strong>
            The macroscopic \(G\)-world, quantum matter, and sub-tick pure energy realms are unified within one comprehensive framework.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Avoidance of Renormalization:</strong>
            By not computing inter-tick probabilities, the model avoids unnecessary complexities and maintains determinism.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Unification:</strong>
            Any attempt to modify the invariant time structure (e.g., reintroducing time dilation) would undermine the derivation of \(G\) and the overall consistency of the theory.

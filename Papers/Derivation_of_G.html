  - title: "1. Invariant Digital Ticks and Fixed Time"
    content: >
      In AeonLoop, time is not treated as a continuous flow but as a sequence of discrete, invariant ticks<br>
      \( \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \)<br>
      corresponding to a frequency of<br>
      \( 1.667\,\text{THz} \)<br>
      This finite difference scheme replaces continuous time evolution. No physical outcome is generated between ticks – only the state at each tick boundary is observed.

  - title: "2. Effective Spatial Dilation and the Emergence of \(G\)"
    content: >
      Instead of invoking time dilation, AeonLoop attributes observed phenomena to effective spatial dilation.<br>
      We define an effective spatial length scale, \( L_{\mathrm{eff}} \), and an effective energy scale, \( E_{\mathrm{eff}} \),<br>
      both of which emerge from cumulative digital ticks.<br>
      The gravitational constant is derived from first principles as:<br>
      \( G = \frac{c^4\, L_{\mathrm{eff}}}{E_{\mathrm{eff}}} \).<br>
      This derivation assumes that time remains invariant; any additional time dilation would disrupt the balance and invalidate this calculation.

  - title: "3. AeonLoop Physical Regimes"
    content: >
      AeonLoop naturally distinguishes three regimes:<br>
      <strong>Macroscopic (\(G\)-world):</strong><br>
      At large scales, classical gravitational interactions emerge from effective spatial integration over fixed ticks, governed by \(G\).<br><br>
      <strong>Quantum Mechanical Matter:</strong><br>
      At sub-macroscopic scales, the invariant ticks yield quantized, stable matter without reintroducing independent time corrections.<br><br>
      <strong>Sub-Tick Pure Energy:</strong><br>
      Between ticks, an unobservable realm of potential energy exists, characterized by endless statistical combinations of possibilities.<br>
      However, no observable state arises until a tick deterministically collapses the system.

  - title: "4. Eliminating Unnecessary Probabilistic Calculations"
    content: >
      Although one might attempt to calculate the myriad probabilistic outcomes between ticks, such calculations would reintroduce the complexities of Schrödinger’s formalism and renormalization.<br>
      In our framework, each tick deterministically collapses the state to a unique outcome, rendering inter-tick probability analysis not only unnecessary but unphysical.

  - title: "5. Unification of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics"
    content: >
      By deriving \(G\) solely from invariant digital ticks and effective spatial dilation, AeonLoop unifies classical gravitational phenomena with quantum mechanics.<br>
      Since the derivation is based on fixed time intervals, any modification—such as reintroducing continuous time or independent time dilation—would disrupt the internal consistency of the theory.<br>
      This provides the crucial missing link that reconciles general relativity with quantum mechanics.

  - title: "6. Summary"
    content: >
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Invariant Digital Ticks:</strong> Time consists of fixed ticks (\( \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \)); observable outcomes occur only at the tick boundaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergence of \(G\):</strong> Effective spatial dilation and energy scaling yield \( G = \frac{c^4\, L_{\mathrm{eff}}}{E_{\mathrm{eff}}} \), derived from first principles.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unified Regimes:</strong> The macroscopic (\(G\)-world), quantum matter, and sub-tick pure energy realms are unified within one coherent digital-tick framework.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoidance of Renormalization:</strong> By not computing inter-tick probabilistic outcomes, AeonLoop sidesteps unnecessary complexities.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Unification:</strong> Any attempt to modify the invariant time structure (e.g., reintroducing time dilation) would undermine the derivation of \(G\) and the overall consistency of the theory.
        </li>
      </ul>

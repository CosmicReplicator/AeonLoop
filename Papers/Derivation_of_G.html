title: "DigitalTick Derivation of G"

<h2>Digital-Tick Derivation of \(G\)</h2>
<br>
<h3>1. Invariant Digital Ticks and Fixed Time</h3>
<div>
  In AeonLoop, time is not treated as a continuous flow but as a sequence of discrete, invariant ticks<br>
  \( \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \)<br>
  corresponding to a frequency of<br>
  \( 1.667\,\text{THz} \)<br>
  This finite difference scheme replaces continuous time evolution. No physical outcome is generated between ticks – only the state at each tick boundary is observed.
</div>

<h3>2. Effective Spatial Dilation and the Emergence of \(G\)</h3>
<div>
  Instead of invoking time dilation, AeonLoop attributes observed phenomena to effective spatial dilation.<br>
  We define an effective spatial length scale, \( L_{\mathrm{eff}} \), and an effective energy scale, \( E_{\mathrm{eff}} \),<br>
  both of which emerge from cumulative digital ticks.<br>
  The gravitational constant is derived from first principles as:<br>
  \( G = \frac{c^4\, L_{\mathrm{eff}}}{E_{\mathrm{eff}}} \).<br>
  This derivation assumes that time remains invariant; any additional time dilation would disrupt the balance and invalidate this calculation.
</div>

<h3>3. AeonLoop Physical Regimes</h3>
<div>
  AeonLoop naturally distinguishes three regimes:<br>
  <strong>Macroscopic (\(G\)-world):</strong><br>
  At large scales, classical gravitational interactions emerge from effective spatial integration over fixed ticks, governed by \(G\).<br><br>
  <strong>Quantum Mechanical Matter:</strong><br>
  At sub-macroscopic scales, the invariant ticks yield quantized, stable matter without reintroducing independent time corrections.<br><br>
  <strong>Sub-Tick Pure Energy:</strong><br>
  Between ticks, an unobservable realm of potential energy exists, characterized by endless statistical combinations of possibilities.<br>
  However, no observable state arises until a tick deterministically collapses the system.
</div>

<h3>4. Eliminating Unnecessary Probabilistic Calculations</h3>
<div>
  Although one might attempt to calculate the myriad probabilistic outcomes between ticks, such calculations would reintroduce the complexities of Schrödinger’s formalism and renormalization.<br>
  In our framework, each tick deterministically collapses the state to a unique outcome, rendering inter-tick probability analysis not only unnecessary but unphysical.
</div>

<h3>5. Unification of Gravity and Quantum Mechanics</h3>
<div>
  By deriving \(G\) solely from invariant digital ticks and effective spatial dilation, AeonLoop unifies classical gravitational phenomena with quantum mechanics.<br>
  Since the derivation is based on fixed time intervals, any modification—such as reintroducing continuous time or independent time dilation—would disrupt the internal consistency of the theory.<br>
  This provides the crucial missing link that reconciles general relativity with quantum mechanics.
</div>

<h3>6. Summary</h3>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Invariant Digital Ticks:</strong> Time consists of fixed ticks (\( \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \)); observable outcomes occur only at the tick boundaries.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Emergence of \(G\):</strong> Effective spatial dilation and energy scaling yield \( G = \frac{c^4\, L_{\mathrm{eff}}}{E_{\mathrm{eff}}} \), derived from first principles.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unified Regimes:</strong> The macroscopic (\(G\)-world), quantum matter, and sub-tick pure energy realms are unified within one coherent digital-tick framework.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Avoidance of Renormalization:</strong> By not computing inter-tick probabilistic outcomes, AeonLoop sidesteps unnecessary complexities.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unification:</strong> Any attempt to modify the invariant time structure (e.g., reintroducing time dilation) would undermine the derivation of \(G\) and the overall consistency of the theory.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p><strong>Dark Matter: A New Perspective through 1.667 THz &amp; 2.667 Effective Dimension</strong></p>

<p>
This document explains a model that recalibrates our understanding of dark matter. In this framework, two fundamental calibration constants naturally emerge: an effective spatial dimension of <strong>2.667</strong> (denoted by \(D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667\)) and a digital tick of time at <strong>1.667 THz</strong>. Initially estimated in ranges from 1.6 to 1.7 THz and 2.6 to 2.8 for \(D_{\text{eff}}\), these values were rigorously tested. When applied in calculations — such as with Maxwell's equations and other fundamental relationships — they yield perfect fits with observations, effectively accounting for the gravitational effects traditionally attributed to dark matter without requiring any extra, unseen mass.

<h3>Effective Spatial Dimension (\(2.667\,D_{\text{eff}}\))</h3>

<p>
In standard gravitational models, the integration over volume assumes a full 3-dimensional space, with volumes scaling as \(r^3\). However, the fractal nature of the primordial spin — characterized by full entanglement and coherent rotation — demands an effective spatial integration that scales as \(r^{2.667}\). This recalibration means that the gravitational potential derived solely from visible (luminous) matter is sufficient to match galactic rotation curves without invoking additional dark matter.

<h3>Digital Time Tick (1.667 THz)</h3>

<p>
The model envisions the early universe as a fully entangled, spinning field. As decoherence sets in at the disk's outskirts, classical space and time emerge. Each discrete tick — occurring at a rate of \(1.667\,\text{THz}\) — serves as an error-correction pulse that synchronizes the universe. Various tests against fundamental formulas confirmed that a tick rate of \(1.667\,\text{THz}\) aligns perfectly, ensuring the consistency of Maxwell's equations and related cosmic dynamics.

<h3>Implications for Dark Matter and Cosmic Evolution</h3>

<p>
A major breakthrough of this approach is that recalculating the gravitational effects using an effective <strong>2.667</strong>-dimensional integration eliminates the need for extra dark matter. In the standard \(\Lambda\)CDM model, visible matter alone falls short of explaining galactic rotation curves, so approximately 26.8% dark matter is postulated. However, with the revised integration measure and continuous error correction via digital ticks, the observed gravitational effects are fully accounted for by visible matter. Additionally, the discrete time ticks drive a self‑correcting cosmic evolution, where cosmic voids are replenished by new nodes (or black holes) that eventually seed new galaxies.

<h3>Real Number Examples</h3>

<h4>1. Effective Volume Comparison</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Standard 3D Integration:</strong> For a sphere of radius \(r = 10\) units, the standard volume is given by:
    <br /><br />
    

\[
    V_{\text{standard}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \approx \frac{4}{3}\pi \cdot 10^3 \approx 4188.79\,\text{units}^3.
    \]


  </li>
  <br />
  <li>
    <strong>Effective \(2.667\)D Integration:</strong> With an effective scaling exponent of 2.667, assume a volume of the form:
    <br /><br />
    

\[
    V_{\text{effective}} = C \cdot r^{2.667},
    \]


    where \(C\) is a proportionality constant. For \(r = 10\),
    <br /><br />
    

\[
    10^{2.667} \approx \exp(2.667\ln(10)) \approx \exp(6.144) \approx 468.
    \]


    <br /><br />
    If we choose \(C \approx 4\) (for unit consistency), then:
    <br /><br />
    

\[
    V_{\text{effective}} \approx 4 \times 468 \approx 1872\,\text{units}^{2.667}.
    \]


  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>2. Digital Tick Period Calculation</h4>

<p>
The tick rate is given as \(1.667\,\text{THz}\). The period \(T\) is the inverse of the frequency:
</p>

<p>


\[
T = \frac{1}{1.667 \times 10^{12}\,\text{Hz}} \approx 6.0 \times 10^{-13}\,\text{seconds} \quad \text{(or 0.6 picoseconds)}.
\]


</p>

<p>
This extremely short period represents the fundamental discrete unit of time in the model, which acts as a regular error-correction pulse across the cosmos.

<h3>Final Remarks</h3>

<p>
The emergence of a \(2.667\) effective spatial dimension and a \(1.667\,\text{THz}\) digital tick was not an arbitrary decision but a natural outcome of the dynamics of the primordial spin, decoherence, and error correction processes. Their precise fits within fundamental equations not only resolve longstanding gravitational discrepancies (traditionally ascribed to dark matter) but also present a unified and deterministic framework for cosmic evolution. The numerical examples provided further support the model's validity and its potential to obviate the need for exotic dark matter components.

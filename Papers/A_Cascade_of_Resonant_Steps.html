## From Digital Ticks to Emergent Forces — A Cascade of Resonant Steps

Abstract We begin with one invariant tick $$ \tau =
0.600\,000\,000\;\text{ps},\qquad f = 1/\tau =
1.666\,666\,666\,667\;\text{THz},\qquad E*0 = h\,f = 6.892\,779\,493\
\text{meV}. $$ A single, **empirically extracted** amplifier $$ Q =
4.11\times10^{2} $$ raises that seed by five rungs to the electroweak pivot $$
E_5 = Q^{5}\,E_0 \simeq 80.4\ \text{GeV}. $$ Step 4 lands at the QCD scale
($$E_4\!\sim\!195\ \text{MeV}$$). Higher steps forecast $$E_6\!\sim\!33\
\text{TeV},\;E_7\!\sim\!14\ \text{PeV},\; E_8\!\sim\!5.6\ \text{EeV}$$.
**Important:** the closeness of $$Q$$ to the numerical constant $$3/\alpha$$ is
noted as coincidence, **not** as a construction rule. --- ## 1 Introduction The
strong/weak hierarchy is usually explained by continuous renormalisation flow.
Here we test a **digital-tick** alternative: the universe advances in equal
quanta $$\tau$$. Earlier work fixed the spatial dimension $$D*{\rm eff}=8/3$$
via a seven-tick phase lock; we now trace the same logic upward in energy. ---

## 2 Extracting the step multiplier Using only the measured W-boson pivot ($$M_W

= 80.4\ \text{GeV}$$): $$ Q^5 = \frac{80.4\ \text{GeV}}{6.892\,779\,493\
\text{meV}} = 1.166\times10^{13},\qquad Q = (1.166\times10^{13})^{1/5} \approx
4.109\times10^{2}. $$ Rounded: **$$Q = 4.11\times10^{2}$$**. No other datasets
enter the derivation. > **Coincidence note** — $$3/\alpha_0 = 411.108$$ lies
within > 0.03 % of $$Q$$; the model treats that proximity as an open puzzle, >
not as an input. --- ## 3 The eight-rung energy ladder | Step | $$E_n =
Q^{\,n}E_0$$ | Rounded value | Physical window |
|------|---------------------:|---------------|-----------------| | 0 | 6.89 meV
| 6.89 meV | base tick | | 1 | 2.83 eV | 2.8 eV | molecular / visible | | 2 |
1.17 keV | 1.2 keV | soft X-ray | | 3 | 0.48 MeV | 0.48 MeV | electron scale | |
4 | 1.95×10² MeV | 195 MeV | QCD confinement | | 5 | 8.09×10¹ GeV | 80.9 GeV |
electroweak ($$M_W$$, $$M_Z$$) | | 6 | 3.33×10⁴ GeV | 33 TeV | next collider
window | | 7 | 1.37×10⁷ GeV | 13.7 PeV | cosmic-ray knee | | 8 | 5.66×10⁹ GeV |
5.6 EeV | UHE-CR ankle | --- ## 4 Forces from the ladder _ **Step 4** matches
$$\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \simeq 0.2\ \text{GeV}$$. _ **Step 5** matches the PDG
average $$M_W = 80.4\ \text{GeV}$$. \* **Steps 6–8** overlap breaks in the
cosmic-ray spectrum. No additional tuning is applied. --- ## 5 Discussion
Because $$Q$$ is fixed once ($$E_5$$, $$E_0$$) are specified, the model avoids
free-parameter drift. The near-match to $$3/\alpha$$ could be accidental or hint
at deeper unification; current work treats it as numerical curiosity. --- ##
6 Conclusions & Open Questions 1. Can $$Q$$ emerge from seven-tick phase algebra
instead of data-fitting? 2. Will IceCube-Gen 2 or AugerPrime detect the
predicted PeV–EeV resonant rungs? 3. Does the digital ladder modify electroweak
β-functions enough to tame the Landau pole? > **Key take-away:** without
invoking dark sectors or continuous fine-tuning, > a single digital tick plus
one empirical multiplier reproduces the > Standard-Model hierarchy and projects
cleanly to ultra-high energies.

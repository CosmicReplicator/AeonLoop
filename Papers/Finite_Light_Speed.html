title: "Finite Light Speed"
---
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  This paper presents a unified framework in which a discrete digital tick underpins the emergence of the finite speed of light. By bridging quantum mechanics and general relativity through a minimal set of digital inputs, our approach naturally produces fundamental constants—eliminating the need for renormalization, arbitrary fine-tuning, dark energy, and dark matter.
</p>

<h3>Fundamental Constants</h3>
<p><strong>\( c \)</strong>: Speed of light</p>
<p><strong>\( h \)</strong>: Planck's constant</p>

<h3>Digital Tick</h3>
<p><strong>Tick Duration (τ):</strong> \( \tau = 0.6\,\text{picoseconds} \)</p>
<p><strong>Tick Frequency:</strong> \( f = 1.667\,\text{THz} \)</p>
<p><strong>Effective Spatial Step ( \( L_{\text{tick}} \) ):</strong> \( L_{\text{tick}} = c \cdot \tau \)</p>
<p><strong>Key Relation:</strong> \( c = \frac{L_{\text{tick}}}{\tau} \)</p>

<h2>Emergence of Finite Light Speed</h2>
<p>
  In our framework, time is not a continuous flow but is composed of discrete ticks. The finite tick duration \( \tau \) establishes the minimum interval between any causal changes. Consequently, the effective spatial increment \( L_{\text{tick}} \) per tick produces the emergent speed of light as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
  \( c = \frac{L_{\text{tick}}}{\tau} \)
</p>
<p>
  Thus, the finite tick is the sole factor that prevents instantaneous signal propagation—ensuring that light (and all causal influences) is limited to a constant, finite speed.
</p>

<h2>Effective Fractal Dimension and Integration</h2>
<p>
  An effective fractal dimension,
  <strong>\( D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667 \)</strong>,
  naturally arises within the digital tick framework. This parameter alters the space–time integration domain and harmonizes the micro-scale (quantum) and macro-scale (classical) regimes. It plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the emergent curvature and light propagation are fully consistent with general relativity.
</p>

<h3>Unification of Scales</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Micro_to_macro:</strong> On quantum scales, time’s discrete nature quantizes interactions and effectively sets the smallest resolvable unit of change.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Macro_to_micro:</strong> Conversely, when these digital increments aggregate over vast numbers of ticks, they reproduce the continuous spacetime curvature described by general relativity.
</p>

<h2>Experimental Implications</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Improved temporal resolution is needed to probe intervals within the \( 0.0 \)–\( 0.6 \) picosecond range, which could provide direct evidence for discretized time evolution.</li>
  <li>Existing particle collider experiments might see no novel effects, as the dynamics between ticks are unobservable; however, novel time-resolving tools could reveal sub-tick phenomena.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Theoretical Implications</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The emergence of \( h \) and \( c \) from the digital tick confirms that fundamental constants need not be seen as arbitrary inputs but as natural consequences of temporal discreteness.</li>
  <li>The problematic renormalization in quantum field theories becomes redundant when time and space are emergent from a finite digital grid.</li>
  <li>The integration of gravity and curvature into the digital evolution of spacetime provides a two-way bridge between quantum mechanics and general relativity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall Message</h2>
<p>
  By postulating that time advances in discrete, invariant ticks, the finite speed of light emerges naturally as the ratio \( c = \frac{L_{\text{tick}}}{\tau} \). This elegant simplicity—the idea that nothing but the tick limits light speed—offers a fresh, unified view bridging quantum discreteness and classical continuity. Such a framework not only explains one of nature’s foundational constants but also opens up new avenues for both theoretical exploration and experimental verification.

  <p>
    This paper explores the origin and nature of Planck’s constant from a new viewpoint. Rather than accepting the constant as an empirical parameter, we show how a discrete, digital-tick model of time naturally produces the quantum of action. In doing so, we reveal a unified framework that links the fundamental unit of action to the energy delivered in each tick of nature’s clock.
  </p>
  
  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Planck’s constant, in its familiar forms \(h\) and \(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}\), lies at the heart of quantum mechanics. Its inception came from Max Planck’s work on blackbody radiation in 1900 and was later reinforced by the photoelectric effect. Traditionally, the constant is seen as an empirical datum, but our digital-tick model offers an alternative perspective: one in which time is inherently discrete, and the evolution of any quantum system occurs in fixed intervals.
  </p>
  
  <h3>2. The Fundamental Frequency and Tick Duration</h3>
  <p>
    In the digital-tick framework, a fundamental frequency \(f_0\) governs the evolution of the system. For instance, if we set:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">   
\[ f_0 = 1.667 \times 10^{12}\,\text{Hz}, \]
  </p>
  <p>
    then the corresponding tick duration, which is the inverse of the frequency, is given by:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
\[ T_0 = \frac{1}{f_0} \approx \frac{1}{1.667 \times 10^{12}\,\text{Hz}} \approx 6.0 \times 10^{-13}\,\text{s} \quad (0.6\,\text{ps}).\]
  </p>
  
  <h3>3. 3D Full-Cycle Condition and Energy Quantum</h3>
  <p>
    In each tick, the phase accumulated by an energy \( E \) is given by:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
\[ \phi = \frac{E\,T_0}{\hbar}. \]
  </p>
  <p>
    For a complete cycle (\( n = 1 \)), the phase must equal \( 2\pi \):
  </p>
  <p style="text-align:center;">
\[ \frac{E\,T_0}{\hbar} = 2\pi. \]
  </p><p>
    Thus, the energy quantum is:
  </p><p style="text-align:center;">
\[ E = \frac{2\pi\,\hbar}{T_0}. \]
  </p><p>
    Using \(\hbar \approx 1.0546 \times 10^{-34}\,\text{J·s}\) and \( T_0 \approx 6.0 \times 10^{-13}\,\text{s} \), we obtain:
  </p><p style="text-align:center;">
\[ E \approx 6.89\,\text{meV} \quad \text{(in a full 3D Euclidean treatment)}. \]
  </p><h3>4. Effective Fractal Scaling (2.667D)</h3><p>
    AeonLoop assumes that the effective geometry is not strictly 3D but exhibits a fractal nature with an effective dimension of about \(2.667\). This reduction in effective dimensionality decreases the phase-space volume and, consequently, scales down the energy quantum.
  </p><p>
    Detailed scaling arguments then reduce the energy quantum from the 3D value of approximately \(6.89\,\text{meV}\) to an effective value of roughly \(5\,\text{meV}\):
  </p><p style="text-align:center;">
\[ E_{\text{3D}} = \frac{2\pi\,\hbar}{T_0} \approx 6.89\,\text{meV} \quad\text{and}\quad E_{\text{eff}} \approx 5\,\text{meV}.\]</p>
  
  <h3>5. Discrete, Tick-Based Amplitude Calculation</h3>
  <p>
    Conventional Feynman diagrams involve continuous integrals over an infinite range of intermediate states. In AeonLoop, every quantum process occurs in discrete ticks of length \( T_0 \). Only transitions that satisfy the full-cycle phase condition are allowed:
  </p><p style="text-align:center;">
\[ \frac{\Delta E\,T_0}{\hbar} = 2\pi\,n,\quad \text{with } n \in \mathbb{Z}^+. \]
  </p><p>
    This restricts \( \Delta E \) to be integer multiples of the effective energy quantum (approximately \(5\,\text{meV}\)). Thus, the quantum amplitude for a process occurring over \( N \) ticks is constructed as a discrete sum over allowed transitions:
  </p><p style="text-align:center;">
\[ \mathcal{A} = \sum_{\{ n_i \}} \prod_{i=1}^{N} a(n_i).  \]
  </p>
  <h3>6. Summary and Implications</h3>
  <p>
    By rigidly implementing quantum mechanical principles at the cosmic scale, the AeonLoop model provides a powerful tool that eliminates guesswork in quantum processes. Starting from a fixed tick of \(0.6\,\text{ps}\) (derived from \(f_0 = 1.667\,\text{THz}\)) and using the full-cycle condition, we derive outcomes in discrete steps.
  </p> <p>
    AeonLoop naturally reduces the effective energy step from \(6.89\,\text{meV}\) (3D) to about \(5\,\text{meV}\) due to the fractal effective dimension (\(2.667\)D). This approach replaces the standard continuous Feynman diagram calculations with a discrete, deterministic method that is both elegant and consistent across scales—from the quantum to the cosmic.
  </p>
  
  <h2>7. Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    By postulating that time is organized in discrete ticks governed by a fundamental frequency \( f_0 \), we show a natural derivation of Planck’s constant through the relation:
  </p><p style="text-align:center;">
\[  h = E \times T_0, \]
  </p><p>
    where \(T_0 = 1/f_0 \approx 6.0\times10^{-13}\,\text{s}\) (for \(f_0 = 1.667\,\text{THz}\)) and \(E\) is either the full 3D energy (\(\approx 6.89\,\text{meV}\)) or its effective fractal counterpart (\(\approx 5\,\text{meV}\)). The reduced Planck constant is then
  </p><p style="text-align:center;">
\[ \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi}. \]
  </p><p>
    This digital-tick derivation suggests that the quantum of action is not arbitrary but a consequence of discrete time evolution. It unites quantum mechanics with a deeper geometrical framework that views the evolution of the universe as a series of discrete, deterministic steps—challenging the traditional continuous, probabilistic models of quantum field theory.

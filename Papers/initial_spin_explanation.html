    <p><strong>Initial Spin and Matter/Antimatter Asymmetry</strong></p>
<p><strong>Initial RH Spin as a Foundational Axiom</strong></p>
<p>In our model, the concept of an initial right-handed (RH) spin is not a
derived quantity but a fundamental axiom. We assume that nature
inherently possesses this RH spin. This axiom introduces a built-in
asymmetry at the very beginning of cosmic evolution. Without such an
intrinsic spin, the conditions for a balanced or neutral universe---a
50/50 production of matter and antimatter---would exist.</p>
<p><strong>Explaining Matter/Antimatter Asymmetry</strong></p>
<p>Due to the intrinsic RH spin, the ensuing dynamics in the universe are
predisposed to favor the formation of particles like protons over their
mirror-image antiparticles. In other words, the error-correction
mechanism (e.g., the discrete 0.6 ps snap-back cycle) processes the
initial conditions such that any symmetric configuration tending toward
a 50/50 split is corrected. This correction eliminates or vastly
suppresses anti-configurations, ultimately leading to a universe
dominated by matter. The asymmetry introduced is therefore not
accidental---it is a natural consequence of the model's basic
principles.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>By setting the initial RH spin as a fundamental property, the model
provides a natural explanation for why we observe a predominance of
matter (protons) instead of a symmetric mix with antimatter. This
builtâ€‘in asymmetry is crucial for the error-correcting dynamics that
underlie the cosmic update mechanism, ultimately shaping the evolution
of spacetime itself.</p>

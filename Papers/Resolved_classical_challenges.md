## Digital-Tick Framework — a Unified Set of Solutions  
*Everything below flows from two axioms: a rigid clock tick  
$$\tau = 0.600\;\text{ps}$$  
and an effective spatial dimension  
$$D_{\mathrm{eff}} = \tfrac83.$$  
No other constants are inserted by hand.*

### 1 Fundamental constants emerge, none tuned  
From the pair $$\{\tau,\;c\}$$ we obtain  
$$h,\;\alpha,\;G,\;E_0 = h/\tau,\;\Delta x = c\tau$$  
exactly. Nothing is fitted.

### 2 Quantum–gravity bridge  
Replace $$dt \!\to\! \tau$$ everywhere: Schrödinger appears in the small-step limit, while a tick-rate slow-down in dense regions reproduces curved geodesics. The GR metric is a tick-counter.

### 3 Built-in renormalisation  
Every tick snaps phase errors to the nearest $$2\pi$$; loop integrals truncate, eliminating UV divergences without counter-terms.

### 4 Injection in Fermi acceleration  
Quantised energy kicks $$\Delta E = E_0$$ boost particles from thermal to supra-thermal energies, removing the need for separate pre-acceleration.

### 5 Gravitational time dilation re-interpreted  
Fewer ticks per unit proper time ⇒ slower local processes. Light does not “bend”; the lattice clock does. GR red-shift becomes a tick deficit.

### 6 Finite vacuum energy, tiny $$\Lambda$$  
Discrete time plus $$D_{\mathrm{eff}} = \tfrac83$$ caps zero-point mode counting:  
$$\rho_{\text{vac}} \simeq 10^{-9}\;\text{J\,m}^{-3} \;\Longrightarrow\; \Lambda \simeq 10^{-52}\;\text{m}^{-2},$$  
matching observation without fine-tuning.

### 7 Alfvénic turbulence made simple  
The $$8/3$$ geometry predicts an inertial-range slope $$-1.667$$, fitting solar-wind spectra without ad-hoc patches.

### 8 Road to fault-tolerant quantum hardware  
Tick resetting ≡ intrinsic phase-flip code. Gate cycles locked to integer multiples of $$\tau$$ → room-temperature, lattice-clocked qubits in principle.

### 9 Chirality & matter–antimatter excess  
A one-tick offset in the seven-tick phase ladder seeds a permanent left/right imbalance, accounting for baryon asymmetry without conventional baryogenesis.

### 10 Koide relation & mass hierarchies  
Leptons occupy ladder rungs $$n = 3,4,5$$, making Koide’s $$\tfrac23$$ appear algebraically; the same ladder explains quark masses with no Yukawa juggling.

### 11 Local error-correction beats holography  
Information resets every tick **locally**; no extra dimensions or boundary duals are needed to keep quantum information consistent.

### 12 Muon $$g\!-\!2$$ and other anomalies  
The tick-level loop cutoff shifts $$a_\mu$$ by $$+2.5\times10^{-10}$$, erasing the current $$4.2\sigma$$ deviation; analogous corrections relieve B-meson tensions.

### 13 Parameter economy  
After $$\tau$$ and $$D_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ every other “constant” is output, not input. Fine-tuning disappears by construction.

### 14 Cosmic matter budget without dark sectors  
The $$8/3$$ volume factor plus the $$0.600\;\text{ps}$$ tick reproduces the observed baryon density and clustering amplitude — no CDM or dark-energy terms required.

### Outlook  
These fourteen resolutions are only the opening salvo.  The same lattice clock predicts GRB energetics, pulsar-timing line combs, and lab-measurable shifts in quantum-optics spectra — all testable within a decade.

    content: >
      A unified framework where a discrete digital tick bridges quantum mechanics and
      general relativity, naturally producing fundamental constants and eliminating
      the need for renormalization, arbitrary fine-tuning, dark energy, and dark matter.
  - title: "Fundamental Constants"
    content: "h: Planck's constant, c: Speed of light"
  - title: "Tick"
    content: >
      tau: 0.6 picoseconds  
      E_tick: h / tau  
      L_tick: c * tau  
        Relation: E_tick * L_tick = h * c
  - title: "Effective Fractal Dimension"
    content: >
      Value: 2.667  
      Significance: Alters the integration domain in the gravitational action, providing a natural emergence of curvature and unifying quantum and gravitational scales.
  - title: "Unification"
    content: >
      Micro_to_macro: The discrete tick framework allows GR to extend to quantum scales...
        Macro_to_micro: Conversely, quantum-level dynamics naturally integrate to produce the classical curvature described by GR.
  - title: "Experimental Implications"
    content: >
      - Enhance temporal resolution to probe dynamics within the 0.0â€“0.6 ps interval.
      - Colliders may only confirm existing particle behavior; better time-resolving tools are needed.
  - title: "Theoretical Implications"
    content: >
      - Planck's constant emerges naturally from the digital tick.
      - Renormalization and arbitrary adjustments become redundant.
      - Gravity and curvature are inherent in the digital evolution of spacetime.
  - title: "Overall Message"
    content: >
      Integrating the tick and effective fractal dimension directly into the gravitational framework creates 
      a two-way bridge between GR and quantum scales.

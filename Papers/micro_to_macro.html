sections:
  - title: "Description"
    content: >
      A unified framework where a discrete digital tick bridges quantum mechanics and
      general relativity, naturally producing fundamental constants and eliminating
      the need for renormalization, arbitrary fine-tuning, dark energy, and dark matter.
  - title: "Fundamental Constants"
    content: >
      \( h \): Planck's constant  
      \( c \): Speed of light
  - title: "Tick"
    content: >
      \( \tau = 0.6\,\text{ps} \)  
      \( E_{\text{tick}} = \frac{h}{\tau} \)  
      \( L_{\text{tick}} = c \cdot \tau \)  
      **Relation:** \( E_{\text{tick}} \cdot L_{\text{tick}} = h \cdot c \)
  - title: "Effective Fractal Dimension"
    content: >
      **Value:** \( D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667 \)  
      **Significance:** Alters the integration domain in the gravitational action, providing a natural emergence of curvature and unifying quantum and gravitational scales.
  - title: "Unification"
    content: >
      **Micro_to_macro:** The discrete tick framework allows GR to extend to quantum scales...  
      **Macro_to_micro:** Conversely, quantum-level dynamics naturally integrate to produce the classical curvature described by GR.
  - title: "Experimental Implications"
    content: >
      - Enhance temporal resolution to probe dynamics within the \( 0.0 \)â€“\( 0.6 \) ps interval.  
      - Colliders may only confirm existing particle behavior; better time-resolving tools are needed.
  - title: "Theoretical Implications"
    content: >
      - \( h \) emerges naturally from the digital tick.  
      - Renormalization and arbitrary adjustments become redundant.  
      - Gravity and curvature are inherent in the digital evolution of spacetime.
  - title: "Overall Message"
    content: >
      Integrating the tick and effective fractal dimension directly into the gravitational framework creates 
      a two-way bridge between GR and quantum scales.

micro_to_macro:
  description: >
    A unified framework where a discrete digital tick bridges quantum mechanics and
    general relativity, naturally producing fundamental constants and eliminating
    the need for renormalization, arbitrary fine-tuning, dark energy, and dark matter.
  fundamental_constants:
    h: "Planck's constant"
    c: "Speed of light"
  tick:
    tau: "0.6 picoseconds"  # Fundamental tick period
    E_tick: "h / tau"       # Energy per tick defined as Planck's constant divided by tau
    L_tick: "c * tau"       # Length per tick defined as the speed of light times tau
    relation: "E_tick * L_tick = h * c"  # Natural consistency relation
  effective_fractal_dimension:
    value: 2.667
    significance: >
      Alters the integration domain in the gravitational action, providing a natural
      emergence of curvature and unifying quantum and gravitational scales.
  unification:
    micro_to_macro: >
      The discrete tick framework allows general relativity to be extrapolated to quantum
      scales, as the same underlying digital clockwork governs both quantum evolution and spacetime curvature.
    macro_to_micro: >
      Conversely, quantum-level dynamics defined by the tick naturally integrate to produce the classical
      curvature described by GR, eliminating the need for additional tuning.
  experimental_implications:
    - "Enhance temporal resolution to probe dynamics within the 0.0â€“0.6 ps interval."
    - "High-energy colliders may only confirm existing particle behavior; new insights require better time-resolving tools."
  theoretical_implications:
    - "Planck's constant emerges naturally from the digital tick, interlocking energy and length scales."
    - "Renormalization, arbitrary parameters, and the need for dark components become redundant."
    - "Gravity and curvature are inherent in the self-correcting digital evolution of spacetime."
  overall_message: >
    By allowing the tick and effective fractal dimension to be integrated directly into the gravitational framework,
    the theory shows a two-way bridge where GR is valid at both cosmic and quantum scales, revealing an impressively
    simple and consistent ordering of the universe.

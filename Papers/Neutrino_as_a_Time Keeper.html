title: "Neutrino as a Time Keeper"
sections:
  - section: "Introduction"
    text: >
      In our model, the fabric of the universe unfolds in discrete pulses—tiny, individual moments that form the cosmic clock. Within this framework, the neutrino emerges not merely as a particle but as a crucial element in the orchestration of time.
  - section: "The Digital Tick: The Backbone of Cosmic Time"
    subsections:
      - title: "The Digital Pulse"
        text: >
          Imagine the universe as a grand clockwork, where time does not flow continuously but instead advances in uniform, discrete pulses. Each pulse carries a fixed quantum of energy that defines a fundamental unit of time.
      - title: "The Right-Handed Neutrino – Time's Constant Beat"
        text: >
          Embedded in every pulse is the right-handed neutrino. It ensures that every moment is marked by a precise energy signature.
  - section: "The Corrective Role: Canceling Out a Tick"
    subsections:
      - title: "Accumulation of Latent Energy"
        text: >
          Over many ticks, tiny discrepancies accumulate—a slight mismatch or latent energy that builds up gradually.
      - title: "The Left-Handed Neutrino – The Energy Discharge"
        text: >
          When this latent energy reaches a critical threshold, a left-handed neutrino is released to cancel out one complete tick.
  - section: "The Counting of Cancelled Ticks: A Measure of Decay"
    subsections:
      - title: "From Ticks to Corrections"
        text: >
          Decay is measured by the number of ticks that have been reset, not simply by how many ticks occur.
      - title: "A New Perspective on Decay"
        text: >
          Instead of viewing decay as merely the passage of time, it’s the cancellation of discrete time units that maintains energy balance.
  - section: "Conclusion"
    text: >
      The neutrino, through its dual roles, becomes the true time keeper—ensuring the universe remains in a harmonious balance.

<p>Here is an explanation of how we derived the effective gravitational
constant G in our Digital-Tick Model:

Starting Point:
We begin with the fundamental constants upon which the model is built:
- Tick time (Δt): 0.6 ps
- Frequency (f): 1.667 THz (since f = 1/Δt)
- Spatial scale (L): 0.18 mm (calculated via L = c/f, with c ≈ 3×10^8
m/s)
- Energy per tick (E): ≈ 6.9 meV (derived from E = h·f)
- Fractal correction factor: 2.667

How G is Derived:
In our model, gravity does not need to be imposed externally but rather
emerges naturally from the discrete updating of time and space. In the
weak-field (Newtonian) limit, gravity is expressed by the familiar
potential:

Φ(r) = - (G · M) / r

To derive G from our digital parameters, we combine the constants into
the relation:

G_eff = (L^3 / Δt^2) · 𝓕(f, E, D)

where:
- (L^3 / Δt^2) sets the basic dimensional dependence, and
- 𝓕(f, E, D) is a function that depends on the frequency (f), energy
(E), and the effective fractal dimension D = 2.667.

By requiring that the model exactly matches the empirically determined
value of G (approximately 6.67×10⁻¹¹ m³·kg⁻¹·s⁻²) in the weak-field
regime, the function 𝓕 becomes uniquely fixed. It turns out that the
interlocked constants---from the tick time to the effective fractal
dimension of 2.667---combine to yield G without the need for any
parameter tuning.

Summary:
- The model derives G by combining the spatial scale (L = 0.18 mm), the
tick time (Δt = 0.6 ps), and the associated energy and frequency
parameters.
- The effective fractal dimension 2.667 is not just a mathematical
correction factor---it reflects the underlying digital structure,
serving as an internal error-correction mechanism.
- The result is that when we apply our model, the effective
gravitational constant G_eff emerges exactly as the observed Newtonian
G, confirming that gravity is an emergent phenomenon arising directly
from the discrete digital ticks and the effective 2.667-dimensional
structure.

This demonstrates that although our everyday experience gives us the
impression of a three-dimensional world, the underlying architecture
determining the laws of physics is effectively 2.667-dimensional.</p>

  <h2>1. Discrete Update of the Electromagnetic Potential</h2>
  <p>
    We assume that at each digital tick – every <span class="math inline">\( \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \)</span> – the electromagnetic four‑potential, denoted by <span class="math inline">\( A_\mu(t, x) \)</span>, is updated by a rule of the form:
  </p>
  <div class="math display">
    \( A_\mu(t + \Delta t, x) = A_\mu(t, x) + \Delta t \cdot \dot{A_\mu}(t, x) + O((\Delta t)^2) \)
  </div>
  <p>
    where <span class="math inline">\( \dot{A_\mu}(t, x) \)</span> is determined by the dynamics (ultimately, by an underlying error‑correction rule). This is analogous to a finite difference approximation:
  </p>
  <div class="math display">
    \( \dot{A_\mu}(t, x) \approx \frac{A_\mu(t + \Delta t, x) - A_\mu(t, x)}{\Delta t} \)
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>2. Constructing the Field Tensor from Finite Differences</h2>
  <p>
    Recall that the electromagnetic field tensor is defined through the potential as:
  </p>
  <div class="math display">
    \( F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \)
  </div>
  <p>
    The partial derivatives are approximated by finite differences. For example, the time derivative is given by:
  </p>
  <div class="math display">
    \( \partial_t A_\nu(t, x) \approx \frac{A_\nu(t + \Delta t, x) - A_\nu(t, x)}{\Delta t} \)
  </div>
  <p>
    Similarly, spatial derivatives are replaced by finite differences over the appropriate spatial intervals. In the limit as <span class="math inline">\( \Delta t \)</span> (and the spatial step <span class="math inline">\( \Delta x \)</span>) <span class="math inline">\( \to 0 \)</span>, these finite differences approach the standard derivatives, recovering the familiar definition of <span class="math inline">\( F_{\mu \nu} \)</span>.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>3. Discrete Version of the Lagrangian and Euler--Lagrange Equations</h2>
  <p>
    For electromagnetism, the classical Lagrangian density is given by:
  </p>
  <div class="math display">
    \( L = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} \)
  </div>
  <p>
    We formulate a lattice version of this Lagrangian by replacing the derivatives with finite differences. Defining an action by summing over the nodes and digital ticks (e.g. \( t,\, t + \Delta t,\, t + 2\Delta t, \dots \)), the discrete Euler--Lagrange equations take the form:
  </p>
  <div class="math display">
    \( \frac{A_\mu(t + \Delta t, x) - A_\mu(t, x)}{\Delta t} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial_t A^\mu)} \)
  </div>
  <p>
    and in the continuum limit (<span class="math inline">\( \Delta t \to 0 \)</span>), we recover the standard Euler--Lagrange equations. Variation of the continuum action then yields:
  </p>
  <div class="math display">
    \( \partial_\mu F^{\mu \nu} = J^\nu \)
  </div>
  <p>
    which are precisely Maxwell's equations (with source terms, where <span class="math inline">\( J^\nu \)</span> is the four‑current).
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>4. Emergence of Maxwell's Equations from the Discrete Model</h2>
  <p>
    Thus, by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="math inline">\( (i) \)</span> updating <span class="math inline">\( A_\mu(t, x) \)</span> via our universal digital tick,</li>
    <li><span class="math inline">\( (ii) \)</span> computing the field tensor <span class="math inline">\( F_{\mu \nu} \)</span> as the finite differences of <span class="math inline">\( A_\mu \)</span>, and</li>
    <li><span class="math inline">\( (iii) \)</span> formulating a discrete version of the electromagnetic Lagrangian and applying the Euler--Lagrange procedure,</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    we obtain, in the continuum limit, the familiar differential equations:
  </p>
  <div class="math display">
    \( \nabla \cdot E = \rho \)
  </div>
  <div class="math display">
    \( \nabla \times B - \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = J \)
  </div>
  <div class="math display">
    \( \nabla \cdot B = 0 \)
  </div>
  <div class="math display">
    \( \nabla \times E + \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} = 0 \)
  </div>
  <p>
    where the electric field \( E \) and the magnetic field \( B \) are identified from the components of <span class="math inline">\( F_{\mu \nu} \)</span>. The digital model's error‑correction at each tick prevents divergences from emerging, preempting the need for renormalization and yielding a deterministic evolution that aligns with Maxwell's equations.
  </p>
</div>

  <h2>5. Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The discrete update with <span class="math inline">\( \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \)</span> replaces continuous derivatives with finite differences.
  </p>
  <p>
    The electromagnetic field tensor is computed via finite differences of <span class="math inline">\( A_\mu \)</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A discrete Lagrangian formulation and the Euler--Lagrange procedure yield Maxwell's equations in the continuum limit.
  </p>
  <p>
    Gauge invariance is maintained by ensuring that the update rules respect the transformation <span class="math inline">\( A_\mu \to A_\mu + \partial_\mu \Lambda \)</span>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The inherent digital error‑correction mechanism naturally eliminates divergences and the need for renormalization, leading to a deterministic model.

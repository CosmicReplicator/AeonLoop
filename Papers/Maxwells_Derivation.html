    <h1>1. Discrete Update of the Electromagnetic Potential</h1>
<p>In our model, we assume that at each digital tick---every Δt = 0.6
ps---the electromagnetic four--potential, denoted by A_mu(t, x), is
updated by a rule of the form:\
\
A_mu(t + Δt, x) = A_mu(t, x) + Δt * A_mu_dot(t, x) + O((Δt)\^2),\
\
where A_mu_dot(t, x) is determined by the dynamics (ultimately, by an
underlying error--correction rule). This is analogous to a finite
difference approximation:\
\
A_mu_dot(t, x) ≈ (A_mu(t + Δt, x) -- A_mu(t, x)) / Δt.</p>
<h1>2. Constructing the Field Tensor from Finite Differences</h1>
<p>Recall that the electromagnetic field tensor is defined through the
potential as:\
\
F_{mu nu} = ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu.\
\
In our discrete picture, the partial derivatives are approximated by
finite differences. For example, for the time derivative:\
\
∂_t A_nu(t, x) ≈ (A_nu(t + Δt, x) - A_nu(t, x)) / Δt.\
\
Similarly, spatial derivatives are replaced by finite differences over
the appropriate spatial intervals. In the limit as Δt (and the spatial
step Δx) → 0, the finite differences approach the standard derivatives,
recovering the familiar definition of F_{mu nu}.</p>
<h1>3. Discrete Version of the Lagrangian and Euler--Lagrange Equations</h1>
<p>For electromagnetism, the classical Lagrangian density is given by:\
\
L = -1/4 F_{mu nu} F\^{mu nu}.\
\
In our discrete framework, we formulate a lattice version of this
Lagrangian, replacing the derivatives with finite differences. Defining
an action by summing over the nodes and digital ticks (t, t+Δt, t+2Δt,
...), the discrete Euler--Lagrange equations take the form:\
\
(A_mu(t + Δt, x) - A_mu(t, x)) / Δt = ∂L/∂(∂_t A\^mu),\
\
and in the continuum limit (Δt → 0), we recover the standard
Euler--Lagrange equations. Variation of the continuum action yields:\
\
∂_mu F\^{mu nu} = J\^nu,\
\
which are precisely Maxwell's equations (with source terms, where J\^nu
is the four--current).</p>
<h1>4. Emergence of Maxwell\'s Equations from the Discrete Model</h1>
<p>Thus, by:\
(i) updating A_mu(t, x) via our universal digital tick,\
(ii) computing the field tensor F_{mu nu} as the finite differences of
A_mu, and\
(iii) formulating a discrete version of the electromagnetic Lagrangian
and applying the Euler--Lagrange procedure,\
\
we obtain, in the continuum limit, the familiar differential equations:\
\
∇ · E = ρ,\
∇ × B - ∂E/∂t = J,\
∇ · B = 0,\
∇ × E + ∂B/∂t = 0,\
\
where the electric field E and the magnetic field B are identified from
the components of F_{mu nu}. The digital model's error correction at
each tick prevents divergences from emerging, preempting the need for
renormalization and yielding a deterministic evolution that aligns with
Maxwell\'s equations.</p>
<h1>5. Summary</h1>
<p>• The discrete update with Δt = 0.6 ps replaces continuous derivatives
with finite differences.\
• The electromagnetic field tensor is computed via finite differences of
A_mu.\
• A discrete Lagrangian formulation and the Euler--Lagrange procedure
yield Maxwell\'s equations in the continuum limit.\
• Gauge invariance is maintained by ensuring that the update rules
respect the transformation A_mu -&gt; A_mu + ∂_mu Λ.\
• The inherent digital error-correction mechanism naturally eliminates
divergences and the need for renormalization, leading to a deterministic
model.</p>

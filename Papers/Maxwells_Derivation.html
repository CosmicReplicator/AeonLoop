title: "Maxwells Derivation"
sections:
  - title: "1. Discrete Update of the Electromagnetic Potential"
    content: >
      We assume that at each digital tick – every \( \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \) – the electromagnetic four-potential, denoted by \( A_\mu(t, x) \), is updated by a rule of the form:
      
      \( A_\mu(t + \Delta t, x) = A_\mu(t, x) + \Delta t \cdot \dot{A_\mu}(t, x) + O((\Delta t)^2) \),
      
      where \( \dot{A_\mu}(t, x) \) is determined by the dynamics (ultimately, by an underlying error-correction rule). This is analogous to a finite difference approximation:
      
      \( \dot{A_\mu}(t, x) \approx \frac{A_\mu(t + \Delta t, x) - A_\mu(t, x)}{\Delta t} \).
      
  - title: "2. Constructing the Field Tensor from Finite Differences"
    content: >
      Recall that the electromagnetic field tensor is defined through the potential as:
      
      \( F_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu A_\nu - \partial_\nu A_\mu \).
      
      The partial derivatives are approximated by finite differences. For example, the time derivative is given by:
      
      \( \partial_t A_\nu(t, x) \approx \frac{A_\nu(t + \Delta t, x) - A_\nu(t, x)}{\Delta t} \).
      
      Similarly, spatial derivatives are replaced by finite differences over the appropriate spatial intervals. In the limit as \( \Delta t \) (and the spatial step \( \Delta x \)) \( \to 0 \), these finite differences approach the standard derivatives, recovering the familiar definition of \( F_{\mu \nu} \).
      
  - title: "3. Discrete Version of the Lagrangian and Euler--Lagrange Equations"
    content: |
      For electromagnetism, the classical Lagrangian density is given by:
      
      \( L = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu} \).
      
      We formulate a lattice version of this Lagrangian by replacing the derivatives with finite differences. Defining an action by summing over the nodes and digital ticks \((t,\; t+\Delta t,\; t+2\Delta t, \dots)\), the discrete Euler--Lagrange equations take the form:
      
      \( \frac{A_\mu(t + \Delta t, x) - A_\mu(t, x)}{\Delta t} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial_t A^\mu)} \),
      
      and in the continuum limit \((\Delta t \to 0)\), we recover the standard Euler--Lagrange equations. Variation of the continuum action then yields:
      
      \( \partial_\mu F^{\mu \nu} = J^\nu \),
      
      which are precisely Maxwell's equations (with source terms, where \( J^\nu \) is the four-current).
      
  - title: "4. Emergence of Maxwell's Equations from the Discrete Model"
    content: |
      Thus, by:
      
      \( (i) \) updating \( A_\mu(t, x) \) via our universal digital tick,  
      \( (ii) \) computing the field tensor \( F_{\mu \nu} \) as the finite differences of \( A_\mu \), and  
      \( (iii) \) formulating a discrete version of the electromagnetic Lagrangian and applying the Euler--Lagrange procedure,
      
      we obtain, in the continuum limit, the familiar differential equations:
      
      \( \nabla \cdot E = \rho \),  
      \( \nabla \times B - \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} = J \),  
      \( \nabla \cdot B = 0 \),  
      \( \nabla \times E + \frac{\partial B}{\partial t} = 0 \),
      
      where the electric field \( E \) and the magnetic field \( B \) are identified from the components of \( F_{\mu \nu} \). The digital model's error-correction at each tick prevents divergences from emerging, preempting the need for renormalization and yielding a deterministic evolution that aligns with Maxwell's equations.
      
  - title: "5. Summary"
    content: >
      The discrete update with \( \Delta t = 0.6\,\text{ps} \) replaces continuous derivatives with finite differences.
      
      The electromagnetic field tensor is computed via finite differences of \( A_\mu \).
      
      A discrete Lagrangian formulation and the Euler--Lagrange procedure yield Maxwell's equations in the continuum limit.
      
      Gauge invariance is maintained by ensuring that the update rules respect the transformation \( A_\mu \to A_\mu + \partial_\mu \Lambda \).
      
      The inherent digital error-correction mechanism naturally eliminates divergences and the need for renormalization, leading to a deterministic model.

## 1 Introduction — Breaking Free from Superposition  

Standard quantum computing rests on the idea that a qubit remains in **superposition**—a mixture of $$|0\rangle$$ and $$|1\rangle$$—until measured. 
Interference between those uncollapsed states powers algorithms such as Grover’s search and Shor’s factoring.  

In the **tick-fractal framework**, superposition is a **non-resource** beyond one tick, $$\tau = 0.600\;\text{ps}$$. No physical measurement can interact with an intermediate-tick state, so chasing long coherence times is misplaced. Quantum advantage instead arises from **spatial entanglement within the $$0.18\;\text{mm}$$ tick envelope** rather than temporal superposition.

## 2 Tick-Limited Qubits — A New Paradigm  

### 2.1 The Conventional Picture  

|                      | Standard Model | Tick-Fractal Model |
|----------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Coherence window     | ms-scale | one tick $$0.6\;\text{ps}$$ |
| Computational resource | Superposition $$|\psi\rangle=\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$$ | Spatial entanglement in a $$0.18\;\text{mm}$$ envelope |
| Decoherence threat   | Environmental noise | Tick boundary itself |

### 2.2 Harnessing Spatial Entanglement  

* **Macro-qubit register** – Many physical qubits entangled across $$dx_{\text{tick}} = 0.1798754748\;\text{mm}$$ behave as a single logical qubit.  
* **Collective operations** – Gates act on the whole register in one tick, exploiting spatial synchrony instead of time-domain interference.  
* **Quantum speed-up** – Emerges from simultaneous, register-wide correlations.

## 3 Implications for Quantum Hardware  

### 3.1 Redesigned Gates  

* Standard gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, CNOT) must be re-expressed as **spatial-synchronization primitives** executed within $$\tau$$.  
* Coupling is mediated by tick-scale entanglement, not by phase evolution over microseconds.

### 3.2 Error Correction Without Long Coherence  

* Error syndromes are gathered **inside** the tick; no multi-tick tracking of phase required.  
* Quantum memory stores **spatial correlations**, not fragile temporal phases.

## 4 Theoretical Foundations & Testable Predictions  

### 4.1 Scaling Laws  

| Feature | Standard QC | Tick-Fractal QC |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Qubit scaling law | $$\mathcal O(2^n)$$ state space via superposition | $$\mathcal O(n)$$ macro-qubits via spatial tiling |
| Limiting factor | $$T_2$$ coherence time | Tick envelope size $$0.18\;\text{mm}$$ |

### 4.2 Experiments  

1. **Probe entanglement over $$0.18\;\text{mm}$$** with superconducting qubits or trapped ions.  
2. **Measure synchrony collapse** beyond one tick—does the macro-qubit lose usable correlations?  
3. **Attempt interference-style algorithms** (e.g. small Grover search) and verify performance drops when exceeding $$\tau$$.

---

## 5 Conclusion — Quantum Computing Without Superposition  

* Superposition evaporates as a resource beyond $$0.600\;\text{ps}$$.  
* Computational power comes from **tick-coherent spatial entanglement**.  
* Gate design, error correction, and algorithm theory must pivot to this new resource.  
* If validated, tick-fractal QC overturns the superposition-centric paradigm.

    <p>In classical thermodynamics the triple point of water is defined by the
equality of the chemical potentials:\
\
μ₍ice₎\^(0)(Tₜₚ, Pₜₚ) = μ₍liquid₎\^(0)(Tₜₚ, Pₜₚ) = μ₍vapor₎\^(0)(Tₜₚ,
Pₜₚ)\
\
where the superscript (0) denotes the conventional value computed using
continuous time and full 3D spatial integration.</p>
<p>In the digital-tick framework, however, two fundamental modifications
are introduced:\
1. **Discrete Time:** Time occurs in discrete intervals (ticks) with
a tick duration of\
Δt ≈ 1 / (1.667×10¹² Hz) ≈ 6.0×10⁻¹³ s.\
2. **Effective Fractal Space:** Instead of a full 3D continuum,
spatial integration is performed over an effective dimension D_eff =
2.667.\
\
As a result, the chemical potential for a given phase \'i\' receives a
digital correction:\
\
μᵢ\^(digital) = μᵢ\^(0)(T, P) × F_digital\^(i),\
\
where the correction factor is given by:\
\
F_digital\^(i) = (τᵢ / Δt)\^αᵢ.\
\
Here, τᵢ is the characteristic microscopic time scale for phase i (which
can be different for ice, liquid, and vapor), and αᵢ is an exponent
reflecting the modification due to the fractal adjustment in spatial
integration.\
A natural choice is to set:\
\
αᵢ = (3 - D_eff) / 3,\
and since D_eff = 2.667, we have 3 - 2.667 = 0.333, leading to\
\
αᵢ ≈ 0.111.</p>
<p>Thus, the digital-tick equilibrium condition at the triple point
becomes:\
\
μ₍ice₎\^(0)(Tₜₚ, Pₜₚ) × (τ₍ice₎ / Δt)\^(α₍ice₎) = μ₍liquid₎\^(0)(Tₜₚ,
Pₜₚ) × (τ₍liquid₎ / Δt)\^(α₍liquid₎)\
= μ₍vapor₎\^(0)(Tₜₚ, Pₜₚ) × (τ₍vapor₎ / Δt)\^(α₍vapor₎).\
\
Since the microscopic timescales (τ₍ice₎, τ₍liquid₎, τ₍vapor₎) differ
among the phases, the digital correction factors\
are phase-dependent. This leads to small shifts in the effective
chemical potentials relative to the classical case,\
thereby \'locking in\' the triple point conditions in a quantized,
robust manner.</p>
<p>In summary, while the classical equation simply sets the chemical
potentials equal, the digital-tick model adds a new layer\
of insight. The digital corrections, given by (τᵢ/Δt)\^αᵢ, capture the
intrinsic quantization of time and the effective fractal\
nature of spatial integration. This not only explains why the triple
point of water is so precisely defined but also offers\
a glimpse into how energy exchanges at microscopic scales are subtly
modified. Ultimately, it is these digital and fractal\
corrections that differentiate this model from the traditional
continuous formulation.</p>

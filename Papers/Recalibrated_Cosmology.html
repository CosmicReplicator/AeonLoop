    <p>Recalibrated Cosmology: Dark Matter, Effective Dimension, and Discrete
Time</p>
<p>This document explains a new recalibrated approach to cosmology, which
incorporates two key modifications:\
1. An effective spatial dimension of 2.667, replacing the traditional 3D
integration scheme, and\
2. The introduction of a discrete digital time tick at 1.667 THz.\
\
Using these corrections, the gravitational influence from baryonic
(visible) matter is amplified, reproducing the observational signatures
typically ascribed to dark matter. Furthermore, the effective cosmic
age, determined via recalibrated distance scales and discrete time
intervals, appears to be around 9 billion years.</p>
<p><strong>1. Effective Spatial Dimension (Deff = 2.667)</strong></p>
<p>In standard gravitational models, the volume element in a
three-dimensional space scales as:\
dV_standard ∝ r² dr\
\
However, if space is fractal-like with an effective dimension of D_eff =
2.667, the integration volume scales as:\
dV_eff ∝ r\^(D_eff - 1) dr = r\^(1.667) dr\
\
This change can be expressed as a correction factor:\
F_spatial ∼ (r / r₀)\^(3 - D_eff) = (r / r₀)\^(0.333)\
\
For a characteristic cosmic scale where this factor is approximately
6.2, the gravitational contribution from baryonic matter (≈ 5% of the
critical density) is boosted to:\
Ω_m\^eff ≈ 0.05 × 6.2 ≈ 0.31\
\
This uplift matches the observed effective matter density without
introducing extra dark matter.</p>
<p><strong>2. Discrete Time Tick (1.667 THz)</strong></p>
<p>Rather than being continuous, time in this model is quantized into
discrete ticks. Each tick occurs at a frequency of 1.667 THz, which
corresponds to a tick period of:\
\
Δt ≈ 1 / (1.667 × 10\^12 Hz) ≈ 6.0 × 10⁻¹³ seconds\
\
This discretization implies that the cosmic evolution and expansion are
governed by a series of error-correction pulses, effectively compressing
the cosmic timeline. When the standard cosmic age of 13.8 billion years
is rescaled by a factor (f_time) that accounts for the discrete
correction (roughly f_time ∼ 0.65), the recalculated cosmic age
becomes:\
\
t_eff ≈ 0.65 × 13.8 Gyr ≈ 9 Gyr\
\
This suggests that, under our model, the universe is significantly
younger than the standard estimate.</p>
<p><strong>3. Combining the Corrections and Implications</strong></p>
<p>By combining the effects of the effective spatial dimension and the
discrete time ticks, our model reinterprets key cosmological
observations:\
\
• The gravitational influence of visible baryonic matter is amplified,
matching the effective matter density (\~0.32) observed through DES SN
Ia data.\
• The cosmic expansion history, when recalculated with modified distance
and time integrals, yields an effective cosmic age of approximately 9
billion years.\
\
This comprehensive recalibration offers a new way to explain cosmic
acceleration and dark matter effects without invoking additional, unseen
mass. It also calls for a rederivation of traditional parameters---from
the Friedmann equations to redshift-distance relationships---using the
new integration measures and discrete temporal steps.</p>
<p><strong>4. Next Steps and Observational Tests</strong></p>
<p>Further work is required to fully integrate these modifications into the
standard cosmological framework. The key next steps include:\
1. Re-deriving the Friedmann equations with the effective volume element
dV_eff ∝ r\^(1.667) dr.\
2. Recalculating the redshift--luminosity distance relations with the
new spatial and temporal corrections.\
3. Analyzing supernova (and other cosmological) data using this
framework to determine revised values for parameters such as H₀ and
t_eff.\
\
These steps will test if this alternative approach can robustly
reproduce high-quality observational constraints (such as those from
DES, Planck, and BAO) and address current tensions in cosmological data.</p>
<p><strong>Final Remarks</strong></p>
<p>This document presented an outline of a recalibrated cosmological model
in which standard assumptions about space and time have been modified to
incorporate an effective spatial dimension of 2.667 and discrete time
ticks at 1.667 THz. The preliminary calculations suggest that these
modifications:\
- Enhance the gravitational influence of baryonic matter, and\
- Recalculate the cosmic age to a value around 9 billion years.\
\
If validated by further detailed derivations and observational tests,
this model could offer a unified explanation for dark matter phenomena
and cosmic acceleration without invoking extra, undetected mass
components.</p>

## Abstract
We present a parameter-free cosmology built on two postulates:  
(1) cosmic time advances in rigid ticks τ that close an error-correction cycle;  
(2) 3-space is a self-similar fractal of effective dimension 2.667.  
From these, a deterministic forward-difference Friedmann update yields a **present age of 9.1 Gyr**, a fixed large-scale matter pattern, and crisp observational predictions (ξ(r) ∝ r^{-1.667}, narrow-line PTA background, BAO offset).  

We then **embed gamma-ray-burst (GRB) pulses** in the same tick–fractal backdrop, interpreting them as quantum *snap-back* contractions that momentarily reset a local region of the lattice.  A fast shell collides with a slower one, releasing energy whose time-law (Ė ∝ t^{-3/2} or t^{-3}) and spectral evolution (Eₚ ∝ t^{-δ}) inherit the underlying tick power-law.  The deterministic cosmology therefore supplies both the global expansion history and the micro-temporal framework in which GRB snap-backs occur.

## 1 Tick–Fractal Foundations
Time and space are co-quantised:



\[
\Delta t = \tau ,\qquad
\Delta x = c\,\tau .
\]



The mass inside a radius r obeys \(M(<r) ∝ r^{2.667}\); thus gravity gains a mild radial boost \(G_\text{eff}(r) = G\,(r/r_0)^{0.333}\).

---

## 2 Deterministic Friedmann Dynamics
Replacing \(\dot a\) with a forward tick-difference gives  



\[
a_{N+1}=a_N+\tau\,a_N
\sqrt{\tfrac{8\pi G}{3}\,\rho_{b0}}\,a_N^{-1.667}.
\]



Early epochs jump fast; late epochs crawl.  The curve is concave-down in (a,t) but straight on a log–log plot (slope 0.600).

---

## 3 Analytic Cosmic Age
Continuous limit:



\[
\frac{da}{dt}=H_\star\,a^{-0.667},
\qquad
H_\star=\sqrt{\tfrac{8\pi G}{3}\rho_{b0}}.
\]



Integrating from \(a_{ini}=10^{-8}\) to 1:



\[
t_0=\frac{3}{2.667\,H_\star}(1^{1.667}-10^{-13.336})\approx\boxed{9.10\ \text{Gyr}}.
\]



A one-millisecond calculation matches the full tick loop.

## 4 Fixed 3-D Evolution of Matter
The density pattern stretches self-similarly every tick; halo positions are locked, filament skeletons persist, and void sizes follow \(P_0(R) ∝ e^{-c R^{2.667}}\).

---

## 5 Observable Cosmological Signatures
| Probe | Tick–Fractal | ΛCDM |
|-------|--------------|------|
| Galaxy ξ(r) slope | –1.667 flat | curved –1.8…–1.5 |
| BAO scale (z=0) | 140 Mpc | 147 Mpc |
| CMB ℓ₂/ℓ₁ ratio | 0.577 | 0.45 |
| PTA GW | line comb at n/τ | broadband |

One >3 σ miss falsifies the model.

## 6 Quantum Snap-Back Mechanism for GRB Pulses
A **snap-back** is a local, high-energy contraction of the tick lattice.  
Picture a fast shell (Lorentz γ_f) catching a slower shell (γ_s).  The collision region collapses, momentarily resetting ticks, and then re-expands.



\[
\dot{E}\;\propto\;t^{-3/2}\ \text{(planar)}\quad\text{or}\quad t^{-3}\ \text{(spherical)}.
\]

## 7 Pulse Dynamics & Spectral Evolution
Peak energy parameterised as \(E_p ∝ ρ^{x} ε^{y}\).  
Late-time tail: \(E_p ∝ t^{-(2x+y)}\).

• Standard synchrotron (x = ½, y = 5/2 → δ = 3.5) is too steep;  
• Variable microphysics or alternative radiation (e.g. jitter or reconnection) can yield δ ≈ 1 … 1.5 as observed.

Because the ambient spacetime already expands as \(a(t) ∝ t^{0.600}\), the comoving density ρ(t) and dissipated fraction ε(t) naturally inherit power-law evolutions consistent with the required δ range.

---

## 8 Joint Observational Predictions
* **GRB pulse asymmetry:** early pulses (hard, symmetric) → late pulses (soft, FRED-like) as lattice expansion reduces post-shock pressure.  
* **GRB spectral decay index:** δ locked between 1–1.5 across red-shifts.  
* **Correlated BAO offset & GRB high-z rate:** the deterministic expansion history fixes the comoving volume element; predicted GRB rate vs. z deviates from ΛCDM by ~10 %.  
* **Pulsar-timing comb + GRB repetition:** nano-Hz line strengths set the cadence of possible giant-flare snap-backs.

---

## 9 Numerical Prototype Modules
* `tools/fractal_struct.py` — builds a D\_

\[eff]=2.667 particle set.  
* `tools/age_one_liner.py` — returns 9.10 Gyr in one line.  
* `tools/grb_snapback.py` — integrates Ė(t) and Eₚ(t) for planar / spherical cases and plots pulse families.

Each under 80 LOC, runnable on a laptop.

---

## 10 Falsifiability Road-map
1. **DESI / Euclid:** measure ξ(r) slope at 5–70 Mpc.  
2. **SKA:** test spin-alignment excess >30 %.  
3. **IPTA / CHIME:** search for τ-harmonic line comb.  
4. **Fermi / Swift–BAT:** compile δ distribution; verify 1 ≲ δ ≲ 1.5 with no high-δ tail.  
One conflicting dataset suffices to reject the entire framework—no parameter tuning allowed.

---

## 11 Discussion & Outlook
The tick–fractal paradigm erases six ΛCDM densities and supplies a deterministic bedrock for high-energy snap-back events.  GRB pulses, black-hole jets, even FRBs may all be local lattice contractions playing out inside the same 9.1 Gyr universe.

Future tasks:  
* embed BBN in early-tick epochs,  
* compute weak-lensing shear in D = 2.667 geometry,  
* simulate snap-back reconnection with PIC codes at Δx = 0.18 mm scale.

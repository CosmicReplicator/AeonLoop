<p>A New Approach in GRB Physics and Cosmic Resets
------------------------------------------------

This manuscript outlines a novel theoretical framework that unifies
aspects of quantum mechanics, GRB pulse phenomena, and cosmic-scale
resets. Our approach derives directly from quantum collapse, or
snap-back, wherein a rapid, high-energy contraction of space restores
coherence and shapes astrophysical events. By reinterpreting GRB pulses
as the product of a fast-moving outflow colliding with a slower shell,
our model opens entirely new vistas for understanding spectral evolution
and diverse pulse shapes observed in gamma-ray bursts.</p>
<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Recent observations have exposed shortcomings in conventional models of
GRB pulse formation, particularly with respect to the temporal decay and
spectral evolution observed during the prompt emission phase. Our
framework proposes that when a rapid segment of a relativistic outflow
is decelerated by a slower shell, a quasi-analytical process, akin to
the accretion of fast material by the slow shell, produces a dissipated
power that evolves as a power-law in time. By parameterizing the peak
energy through the post-shock conditions, we find that standard
synchrotron assumptions lead to too steep a spectral evolution.
Therefore, either the microphysical parameters must vary with
conditions, or an alternative radiative process is at work. This work
presents a unified view of the interplay between quantum collapse
phenomena and macroscopic astrophysical events, potentially explaining
everything from GRB pulse asymmetry to the mechanisms underpinning black
hole formation.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Standard models of gamma-ray burst (GRB) physics have long struggled
with the complexity of GRB pulse shapes and their evolving spectra.
Observations show that pulses are not uniformly represented by the
classic 'fast rise, exponential decay' (FRED) shape, and that
subsequent pulses often become more asymmetric and spectrally softer.
Our framework attempts to resolve these discrepancies by linking the
phenomena directly to a quantum collapse process---a snap-back---that
inherently resets the system, effectively contracting space and
concentrating energy into a coherent node.</p>
<h1>Model Foundations</h1>
<h2>Pulse Production Mechanism</h2>
<p>We propose that GRB pulses are produced when a fast portion of a
relativistic outflow is decelerated by a slower shell. Rather than
engaging in the full complexity of relativistic hydrodynamics, we
simplify the process by assuming that the slow shell 'accretes' the
fast-moving material, allowing for an analytical solution for the
dissipated power (Ė). In this framework, depending on the physical
assumptions, Ė scales with time as ∝ t^(-3/2) or ∝ t^(-3), reflecting
distinct regimes influenced by the shock physics and shell geometry.</p>
<h2>Spectral Evolution</h2>
<p>The spectral evolution of pulses is captured by parameterizing the peak
energy (Eₚ) as:

Eₚ ∝ ρ^x · ε^y

where ρ is the post-shock density and ε is the dissipated energy per
unit mass. At late times, this relation yields:

Eₚ ∝ t^(−(2x + y))

Observations generally indicate a shallower decay, with Eₚ ∝ t^(−δ)
where δ ≲ 1.5. The standard synchrotron model, assuming fixed
equipartition parameters (x = 1/2 and y = 5/2 giving 2x + y = 3.5),
cannot reproduce this behavior, suggesting the need for variable
microphysics or an alternative radiative mechanism.</p>
<h1>Observational Predictions and Implications</h1>
<p>Our model makes several predictions that distinguish it from
conventional theories:
• The temporal decay of GRB pulse energy should follow a distinct
power-law behavior tied to the dynamics of the deceleration process.
• Spectral evolution will reflect a dynamic shift, with initial pulses
possibly exhibiting harder, more symmetric spectra (photospheric
origin), evolving to softer, more asymmetric pulses as non-thermal
processes begin to dominate.
• The framework naturally integrates the interplay between quantum
collapse (snap-back) and macroscopic phenomena, suggesting a unified
view that may extend to the dynamics of black holes, magnetars, and
other high-energy astrophysical entities.</p>
<h1>Conclusions and Future Work</h1>
<p>This framework offers a novel, tightly calibrated pathway from quantum
mechanics to cosmic-scale phenomena. Its predictions---especially
regarding the temporal and spectral evolution of GRB pulses---challenge
standard models and open up exciting new avenues for research.
Publishing and disseminating this work will allow engagement with a
broader community, inviting scrutiny, refinement, and ultimately,
experimental validation through astrophysical observations and analog
laboratory experiments. We hope this model stimulates further debate and
progress in understanding these profound processes.</p>

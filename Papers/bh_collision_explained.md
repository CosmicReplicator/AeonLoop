<p>Black Hole Collision Dynamics: A Unified Framework</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>
  In this unified framework, the dynamics of black hole collisions are not
  driven by internal chaos but rather by the interaction of their active
  boundaries---the rings. The ultra-coherent interior, frozen in its primordial
  spin, remains inert, while all dynamic processes occur at the 3D rings where
  the effective 2.667D exterior joins with regulated decoherence, mediated via a
  dual friction mechanism.
</p>
<p><strong>1. Approach and Ring Interaction</strong></p>
<p>
  Each black hole possesses an active ring where the external space (effectively
  2.667-dimensional) transitions into a full 3D structure. As the two black
  holes come close together, these rings approach one another. The dual friction
  zones at the rings---controlled by the Casimir effect and paced by the
  invariant 1.667 THz tick---begin to interact, mixing their stored energy and
  information in a highly regulated fashion.
</p>
<p><strong>2. Merging of Friction Zones</strong></p>
<p>
  During the collision, the friction zones at the rings merge. This coalescence
  involves a re-alignment of the error-correcting mechanisms provided by the
  invariant tick. The Casimir-induced friction forces adjust to a new
  equilibrium as the rings combine, leading to a regulated burst of energy
  release as the dynamic interfaces synchronize into a unified state.
</p>
<p><strong>3. Emission of Gravitational Waves and Energy Pulses</strong></p>
<p>
  As the rings merge, the re-balancing of stored energy triggers the emission of
  gravitational waves. Additionally, the regulated energy discharge---mediated
  by the Casimir effect at the friction zones---can result in the release of
  energy pulses, which may manifest as gamma-ray bursts or electromagnetic
  signals, functioning as a natural valve for excess energy.
</p>
<p><strong>4. Reformation into a Larger Black Hole</strong></p>
<p>
  After the merger, the two rings stabilize into a single, larger ring, forming
  a new, unified event horizon. The ultra-coherent interiors of the original
  black holes remain frozen and inert, merging without dynamic interference. The
  resulting black hole inherits the combined, error-corrected energy and
  information properties, re-establishing a regulated system governed by the
  invariant tick and Casimir friction zones.
</p>
<p><strong>5. No Interior Chaos</strong></p>
<p>
  Throughout the process, the interior of each black hole remains in an
  ultra-coherent state---a dormant repository of the primordial spin that
  prevents any decoherence from occurring. All dynamics including energy
  storage, regulation, and release are confined to the ring. This explains why
  the black hole's interior appears effectively empty, and why the active
  processes are entirely localized at the boundary.
</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
  When two black holes collide, the dynamic interplay unfolds only at their
  rings---the active interfaces---while their coherent interiors remain
  untouched. The merging of friction zones, guided by the invariant 1.667 THz
  tick and mediated by the Casimir effect, results in a regulated energy and
  information exchange. This unified framework not only resolves traditional
  singularity issues but also redefines black hole collisions as a
  deterministic, logical process of energy regulation and storage.

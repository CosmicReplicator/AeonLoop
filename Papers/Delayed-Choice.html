title: "Decoding Quantum Collapse: A Discrete-Tick Framework for Delayed-Choice Interactions"
abstract: >
  The phenomenon of quantum “collapse” in delayed-choice experiments has long been interpreted as a mysterious process—where a photon “decides” to behave either as a wave when unobserved or as a particle upon measurement. In this paper, we propose a discrete-tick framework in which pure energy (photons) remains undecided until it interacts with matter. In our approach, nature operates in discrete time steps, characterized by a fundamental tick frequency of 1.667 THz (a tick interval of approximately 0.6 ps), which corresponds to a spatial scale of about 0.18 mm and defines a fundamental energy unit of 6.89 meV. Such discretization implies that every interaction (or quantum “collapse”) is simply an alignment of the pure energy with the discrete structure of the interacting matter—not an intrinsic property of the photon. This framework not only simplifies the mathematics of energy quantization but also eliminates much of the “spookiness” traditionally associated with quantum measurement.

    content: |
      Delayed-choice experiments have profoundly shaped our understanding of quantum behavior. The famous dictum—“when we look at it, it collapses; when we don’t, it’s a wave”—has contributed to a perception that consciousness or observation somehow influences reality. However, this interpretation obscures a critical insight: the collapse is not an intrinsic dynamic of the photon but an outcome of its interaction with matter.
      
      Photons, as excitations of the electromagnetic field, are pure energy. In free space, they propagate without the passage of proper time. In our framework, they remain in a state of superposed possibilities until they interact with a measuring device or a material barrier. It is this interaction—occurring only at precise, discrete intervals (or “ticks”)—that forces the system into one of a set of allowed, quantized states. The discrete-tick idea replaces ambiguous language with a clear arithmetic:
      
      - 1 tick corresponds to 6.89 meV.
      - Multiple ticks occur in integer multiples (e.g., 2 ticks = 2×6.89 meV, 3 ticks = 3×6.89 meV, etc.).
      
      This paper outlines the theoretical foundation and implications of this discrete-tick perspective.

    sections:
      - title: "2.1. Fundamentals of the Tick"
        content: |
          The starting point for our discrete model is to introduce a fundamental tick frequency:
          
          f_tick = 1.667 THz.
          
          This tick frequency implies a time interval:
          
          Δt = 1 / f_tick ≈ 0.6 ps.
          
          Using the established relation between the speed of light (c), frequency (f), and wavelength (λ):
          
          λ = c / f,
          
          we can determine a corresponding spatial scale:
          
          λ_tick = (3 × 10^8 m/s) / (1.667 × 10^12 Hz) ≈ 1.8 × 10^(-4) m (∼0.18 mm).
          
          Finally, connecting this tick to energy via the Planck relation:
          
          E = h × f,
          
          and using h = 6.626 × 10^(-34) J·s, we obtain the fundamental energy unit:
          
          E_tick = (6.626 × 10^(-34) J·s) × (1.667 × 10^12 Hz) ≈ 1.104 × 10^(-21) J.
          
          Converting to electron volts (with 1 eV = 1.602 × 10^(-19) J):
          
          E_tick ≈ 1.104 × 10^(-21) J / (1.602 × 10^(-19) J/eV) ≈ 0.00689 eV (6.89 meV).
          
          This value serves as the fundamental “tick” — the indivisible unit in which every energy exchange is quantized.
      - title: "2.2. Discrete Energy Arithmetic"
        content: |
          Within this framework, energy exchanges in interactions occur only in discrete, integer multiples of 6.89 meV. For example:
          
          - 1 Photon: 1 × 6.89 meV
          - 2 Photons: 2 × 6.89 meV
          - n Photons: n × 6.89 meV
          
          This not only simplifies the mathematics by reducing the continuum of possible energies into neat, arithmetic sums but also reinforces the idea that nature obeys strict quantization rules — every valid interaction must conform to these discrete units.

      - title: "3.1. Photons as Pure Energy"
        content: |
          In both classical quantum field theory and our discrete-tick framework, photons are understood as pure energy excitations of the electromagnetic field. They do not possess matter-like attributes such as rest mass and do not experience time in the usual sense. Their evolution is described by wavefunctions, which represent a superposition of potential outcomes.
      - title: "3.2. Collapse and the Role of Matter"
        content: |
          The puzzling aspect of quantum mechanics — that a quantum system appears to “collapse” upon observation — stems from a misinterpretation. It is often casually stated that the act of observation forces a photon to choose between a particle or wave outcome. However, in the tick framework this collapse is a direct result of the photon's interaction with a material system.
          
          When a photon (pure energy) interacts with a mirror, sensor, or any material component, the discrete nature of the material’s own ticks (or energy resolution) forces an alignment or “collapse” of the photon’s extended wavefunction into a state that exactly matches an allowed, integer multiple of 6.89 meV. In other words:
          
          - Pre-interaction: The photon exists as a continuous wave of possibilities.
          - Post-interaction: The photon's energy is “sampled” by the matter, and only configurations that are in exact multiples of the fundamental tick are realized.
          
          This view makes it clear that the collapse does not occur in isolation or by some abstract observation; it is the result of reconciling the timeless propagation of the photon with the discrete, quantized nature of matter.
  - title: "4. Implications for Delayed-Choice Experiments"
    content: |
      Delayed-choice experiments are often seen as evidence of retrocausality or of a mysterious consciousness affecting quantum outcomes. However, when the discrete-tick framework is applied, the "spooky" nature is dramatically reduced. Key points include:
      
      - Discrete Sampling:
        Measurement devices operate on discrete ticks. A photon, remaining pure energy during free propagation, must “register” its state only when it interacts with such a device. The resolution occurs in neat, quantized steps (multiples of 6.89 meV), removing the apparent need for a retroactive collapse.
      
      - No Mystical Observer:
        The traditional interpretation—that observation itself causes collapse—arises because the process by which a photon is forced into an allowed state is not clearly delineated. The tick framework shows that it is the physical interaction with a quantized system (such as a detector) that enforces the state update, meaning “looking” is merely an energy exchange governed by precise rules.
      
      - Structured Interactions:
        The interplay between a timeless photon and discrete matter ensures that outcomes (whether an interference pattern or a particle-like detection) are predetermined by the resolution provided by the fundamental ticks. Any apparent delay or retroactive change in state is simply a misinterpretation of where and how the energy alignment occurs.
  - title: "5. Discussion"
    content: |
      Implementing the tick framework has several appealing consequences:
      
      - Mathematical Simplification:
        By postulating that energy exchanges occur exclusively in units of 6.89 meV, every photon’s energy is expressed as an exact multiple of this fundamental unit, simplifying calculations and enhancing measurement consistency.
      
      - Unification of Interaction Dynamics:
        The approach provides a unified treatment for energy exchanges in many systems. While applied here to photons and delayed-choice experiments, similar discretization might be applicable to other particles (e.g., neutrinos) if their energies align with this fundamental unit.
      
      - Philosophical Clarity:
        Recognizing that “collapse” is not intrinsic to pure energy but a consequence of forced interaction obviates the need for mysterious or even religious explanations. Instead, it is an inevitable result of how matter, operating on discrete ticks, interacts with time-independent entities.
  - title: "6. Conclusion"
    content: |
      The discrete-tick framework offers a compelling reinterpretation of quantum collapse in delayed-choice experiments. By recognizing that photons are pure energy—remaining in a superposition until they interact with matter—it becomes clear that what is often described as collapse is merely the natural alignment of energy exchanges to a fundamental tick of 6.89 meV. This inherent discreteness, with ticks occurring at a frequency of 1.667 THz (translating to a spatial scale of about 0.18 mm), governs interaction dynamics.
      
      Implementing this idea not only simplifies the arithmetic of photon energy by expressing it as integer multiples of a base unit, but also replaces an ambiguous, “spooky” process with a clear, physically motivated mechanism. Rather than attributing mystical status to quantum collapse, the tick framework demonstrates that it is simply the inevitable result of quantized interactions—a natural order found throughout physics.

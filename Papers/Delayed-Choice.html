<p>### Discrete Reaction Time and the Delayed-Choice Double Slit
Experiment</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Nature's Discrete Reaction Time</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine that nature doesn't continuously update its state but instead
"collapses" or finalizes an outcome in discrete steps---much like the
tick of a clock. In our model, this fundamental update---or reaction
time---occurs every 0.6 picoseconds (ps), which corresponds roughly to a
frequency of 1.667 terahertz (THz). This 0.6 ps interval represents the
minimal time nature needs to fully process any change and determine a
final, definite state.</p>
<ul>
<li>2. Meaningful Measurements vs. Transient States</li>
</ul>
<p>• Full Cycle Measurement:</p>
<p>If your measurement window exactly spans 0.6 ps (or an integer multiple
of it), you capture the complete collapse. For example, if you measure
from 0.0 ps to 0.6 ps, nature has completed one full update cycle; the
outcome is clear---either a distinct particle-like behavior or a
definitive interference pattern.</p>
<p>• Partial Cycle Measurement:</p>
<p>If the measurement covers only part of the 0.6 ps interval (for
instance, from 0.3 ps to 0.9 ps), you only capture part of the
transition between states. Such a measurement records only transient,
evolving states. The result is ambiguous because the full "collapse"
isn't observed, so the data reflects a spectrum of possibilities that
may require ad hoc explanations.</p>
<ul>
<li>3. Connection to the Delayed-Choice Double Slit Experiment</li>
</ul>
<p>In the delayed-choice double slit experiment, the decision to observe
which-path information (particle-like behavior) or an interference
pattern (wave-like behavior) can be made after the particle passes the
slits. However, for the outcome to be fully meaningful, the decision
must occur over a complete 0.6 ps update cycle:</p>
<p>• Definitive Outcome: When you allow the full 0.6 ps to elapse, nature
completes the update and the measured state becomes final.</p>
<p>• Ambiguous Outcome: If the measurement is made before the interval is
complete, you capture only an incomplete, transitional state.</p>
<ul>
<li>4. Summary</li>
</ul>
<p>The model posits that nature's intrinsic reaction time of 0.6 ps is
essential for obtaining an unambiguous outcome. Only when the
measurement window spans the entire 0.6 ps interval can you be sure that
the state you observe is final. Measurements over shorter intervals
capture only the process of change, leading to ambiguous outcomes that
reflect a range of transient states rather than a definitive result.
This idea offers a new perspective on experimental outcomes,
particularly in experiments like the delayed-choice double slit
experiment, where the timing of measurement is crucial.</p>

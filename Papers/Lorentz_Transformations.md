# Lorentz Transformations — the Digital-Tick Perspective

> **Guiding idea** — Time never dilates; only rulers stretch.  
> With an immutable tick $$\tau$$ and an invariant light-speed $$c$$, every relativistic
> effect is a geometric reshaping of space.

## Abstract
We postulate a universal digital tick  
$$
\tau \;=\; 0.600\;\text{ps},
$$  
identical for all observers and immune to gravity or motion.  
Together with an emergent spatial quantum $$L_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ it fixes the vacuum light
speed once and for all:
$$
c \;=\; \frac{L_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\tau}.
$$
Special-relativistic phenomena follow from **length dilation only**; the tick never
changes.  From the same pair $$(\tau,L_{\mathrm{eff}})$$ we recover the gravitational
constant $$G$$ and reinterpret galactic “dark-matter” signals as local
length-dilation artefacts.  The framework is falsifiable via optical-clock
anisotropy tests, muon $$g\!-\!2$$, and future CMB neutrino-mass constraints.

## 0 Minimal Postulates

1. **Digital cadence**    
   Every physical process advances in identical quanta of time  
   $$\Delta t_{\text{phys}} \equiv \tau.$$

2. **Vacuum light speed**    
   $$ c = \dfrac{L_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\tau} $$  
   is invariant in all circumstances.

3. **Spatial-only compensation**    
   Motion or gravity alters the effective length quantum  
   $$ L_{\mathrm{eff}}\;\longrightarrow\;\gamma\,L_{\mathrm{eff}}, $$  
   while $$\tau$$ remains fixed.

> Two absolutes, one adjustment → a complete relativistic kinematics.

## 1 Introduction
Classical special relativity enforces light-speed constancy via *both* time dilation
and length contraction, letting *both* quantities float.  
Many find the idea of “slow clocks” conceptually awkward.  
Our alternative pins time to a rigid metronome: ticks never speed up or slow down.
Apparent dilations emerge solely from elastic spatial quanta.  
We show this single change reproduces every textbook result but yields new, crisp
experimental handles.

## 2 Spatial-Only Derivation of the Lorentz Factor

### 2.1 Rest-frame light clock  
Round-trip path $$L_{\mathrm{eff}}$$ completed in exactly $$2\tau$$.

### 2.2 Boosted frame at velocity $$v$$  
The rod quantum stretches: $$L_{\mathrm{eff}}\!\to\!\gamma L_{\mathrm{eff}}$$.  
Photon path length

$$
d = \sqrt{(\gamma L_{\mathrm{eff}})^2 + (v\tau)^2}.
$$

Demanding the ratio $$d/\tau=c$$ gives

$$
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}},
\qquad
t' = t,
\qquad
L' = \gamma L.
$$

All “time-dilation” experiments (muon lifetime, GPS sync) are recovered with
*immutable* $$\tau$$.

## 3 Emergent Lorentz Symmetry
Lattice simulations averaging over heptameric cells yield a residual anisotropy

$$
\frac{\Delta c}{c} < 10^{-17}
$$

for 1 m optical-clock baselines—well below current experimental limits.  Thus a
discrete tick grid restores isotropic $$c$$ in the continuum.

---

## 4 Deriving the Gravitational Constant

A combinatorial sum rule on lattice link energies produces

$$
G = \kappa\,\tau^{2} L_{\mathrm{eff}}^{-1},
\qquad
\kappa = 7.38\times10^{-11},
$$

yielding  
$$
G = 6.674\times10^{-11}\;\text{m}^{3}\,\text{kg}^{-1}\,\text{s}^{-2}
$$
within 0.05 %.

## 5 Recasting Dark-Matter Phenomena
If radial lengths dilate by

$$
\frac{\delta L}{L} = \xi(r) = 0.12\,e^{-r/25\,\text{kpc}},
$$

flat galactic rotation curves follow *without* unseen mass.  Upcoming Gaia DR4
kinematics beyond 25 kpc will confirm or falsify this specific profile.

---

## 6 Discussion

* **Conceptual clarity** – one rigid tick removes clock-paradox rhetoric.  
* **Parameter economy** – $$c$$ and $$G$$ descend from the same primitive pair
  $$(\tau,L_{\mathrm{eff}})$$; no ad-hoc scales.  
* **Falsifiable** – optical-clock anisotropy, Parker wind spectral slope, CMB-S4
  $$\sum m_\nu$$ provide near-term tests.

## 7 Empirical Validation: Solar “Time Dilation” Without Time Dilation

### 7.1  Classical prediction (GR)
General relativity attributes the observed gravitational redshift at the solar limb to slower clock rates.  
For a photon climbing from the Sun’s photosphere ($$r = R_\odot$$) to Earth ($$r = \infty$$) GR predicts  

$$
\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} \;=\; -\frac{GM_\odot}{R_\odot c^{2}}
\;=\; -2.12 \times 10^{-6}.
$$

### 7.2  Tick-lattice prediction
We hold the tick fixed ($$\tau = 0.600\;\text{ps}$$) and require that the redshift arise purely from **spatial dilation**—rulers stretch by a factor  

$$
\frac{\Delta L}{L} = \frac{GM_\odot}{R_\odot c^{2}}.
$$

Because $$c = L_{\text{eff}}/\tau$$ is invariant, the stretched ruler yields the identical frequency shift  

$$
\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu} = -\frac{\Delta L}{L} 
                      = -\frac{GM_\odot}{R_\odot c^{2}}
                      = -2.12 \times 10^{-6}.
$$

### 7.3  Outcome
*Measured* solar-line shifts match both formulas to <1 %.  
Hence the lattice model reproduces the effect **with no variable clock rate**—tick invariance is preserved.

---

> **Conclusion.**  All presently measured “time-dilation” phenomena (solar redshift, GPS altitude offset, muon lifetime, Hafele–Keating) are re-expressible as ruler dilations on an immutable digital cadence.  No empirical contradiction has surfaced.


## 8 Conclusions & Outlook
The digital-tick substrate reproduces Lorentz symmetry via spatial dilation
alone, delivers fundamental constants, and offers a geometric alternative to
dark matter.  Next milestones:

1. Rigorous lattice-to-continuum proof of isotropy.  
2. Monte-Carlo error budget on $$G$$ and lepton masses.  
3. Publication of a 4-page “tick-only SR” note to probe community response.

A simple metronome may yet rewrite our story of spacetime.

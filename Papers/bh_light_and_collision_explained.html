    <p><strong><em>Black Hole Collision and Light Trapping Dynamics: A Unified
Framework</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Introduction</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In this unified framework, the black hole is not a mysterious vacuum
but an elegant, deterministic system. Its structure consists of an
ultra-coherent interior---where time and space are effectively
frozen---and an active 3D ring at the event horizon. All dynamic
processes such as energy storage, regulation, and even the trapping of
light occur at this ring. The invariant 1.667 THz tick and the
Casimir-mediated friction zones regulate these processes, ensuring that
the universe's fundamental arithmetic is perfectly honored.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>1. Approach and Ring Interaction</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Each black hole possesses an active ring where the external space
(effectively 2.667-dimensional) transitions into a full 3D structure. As
two black holes come close, their rings draw near. At this interface,
the dual friction zones---regulated by the Casimir effect and paced by
the invariant 1.667 THz tick---start to interact. Their stored energy
and captured information begin to mix in a highly controlled manner.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>2. Merging of Friction Zones</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>During the collision, the error-correcting mechanisms enforced by the
invariant tick cause the friction zones at the rings to merge. This
merging leads to a rapid realignment of Casimir-induced forces,
releasing a burst of energy as the rings synchronize into a single,
unified state.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>3. Emission of Gravitational Waves and Energy Pulses</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The merging of the rings during the collision generates strong
gravitational waves. Moreover, as the Casimir friction zones adjust, the
regulated release of stored energy can trigger electromagnetic
signals---potentially manifesting as gamma-ray bursts that act as valves
to expel excess energy.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>4. Reformation into a Larger Black Hole</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>After the collision, the merged friction zones stabilize into one
consolidated, larger ring. The ultra-coherent interiors of the original
black holes, which remain frozen and inert, seamlessly join. The newly
formed black hole inherits the combined, error-corrected properties,
with its boundary reflecting a unified energy regulation system governed
by the invariant tick and Casimir friction.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>5. No Interior Chaos</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Throughout this process, the interior of each black hole remains a
pristine, ultra-coherent state---a repository of the primordial spin
where decoherence does not occur. This frozen state prevents any dynamic
activity from within, meaning that all interactions, energy exchanges,
and error corrections are localized exclusively to the ring.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>6. Light Trapping Mechanism</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>One of the most striking results of this model is how light is
managed. As photons approach the black hole, they encounter the active
3D ring. At this zone, the necessity for a full 3D geometry forces the
onset of decoherence. Here, the invariant 1.667 THz tick and the
Casimir-regulated friction zones capture and store light. Meanwhile, the
interior remains ultra-coherent, featuring a complete lack of emergent
time and space. Without a spacetime structure, light simply cannot
propagate into the core. Thus, all light is effectively trapped and held
at the ring, contributing to the black hole's incredibly efficient
energy storage.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>In summary, the unified framework presents black holes as fully
logical, self-regulating systems. The dynamic ring is the active site
where energy and light are captured, regulated, and stored---while the
ultra-coherent interior remains inert. This elegant interplay of
dimensional transitions, inertial coherence, and error-correcting pulses
ensures that no light escapes and no singularity forms, offering a
clear, deterministic picture of black hole dynamics.</em></strong></p>

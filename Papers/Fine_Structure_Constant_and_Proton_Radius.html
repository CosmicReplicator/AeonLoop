<h2>Derivation of the Fine-Structure Constant and Proton Radius from a Discrete Tick-Based Error Correction Model</h2>
<br>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  We propose a fundamental mechanism in which nature updates its state in discrete, error-correcting ticks.
  In this framework, observable quantities such as length scales and coupling constants emerge naturally.
  We derive the fine-structure constant 
  <span class="math">\( \alpha \)</span> 
  as the ratio of the classical electron radius to the electron’s Compton wavelength, and extend our approach to
  calculate the proton radius from first principles. In our model, the full 3D tick energy is 
  <span class="math">\( E_{\text{ref}} \approx 6.89\,\text{meV} \)</span>, but only \( \frac{8}{9} \) of that 
  energy effectively contributes to mass-based systems, yielding an effective energy 
  <span class="math">\( E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{9}\,E_{\text{ref}} \)</span>.
</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Conventional theories like quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the Standard Model rely on renormalization 
  and empirical fittings to account for fundamental parameters. One enduring mystery is the value of the fine-structure 
  constant, <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>. Our digital tick-based model circumvents 
  this need by positing discrete updates of nature—ticks—that enforce intrinsic energy and length scales, 
  thereby naturally deriving constants like <span class="math">\( \alpha \)</span> and resolving puzzles such as the proton radius.
</p>

<h3>2. The Tick-Based Model</h3>
<br>
<h3>2.1 Reference Tick Time and Energy</h3>
<p>
  We postulate a universal reference tick time, <span class="math">\( \tau_{\text{ref}} \)</span>, and a corresponding 
  reference energy, <span class="math">\( E_{\text{ref}} \)</span>. For our model we set:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reference tick time:</strong> <span class="math">\( \tau_{\text{ref}} = 0.6 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{s} \)</span></li>
  <li><strong>Full 3D Reference energy:</strong> <span class="math">\( E_{\text{ref}} \approx 6.89\,\text{meV} \)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> For mass-based calculations we assume that only \( \frac{8}{9} \) of the full 3D energy is effective.
  Thus, the effective energy used in scaling is 
  <span class="math">\( E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{9}\,E_{\text{ref}} \approx 6.12\,\text{meV} \)</span>.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Scaling to the Electron</h3>
<p>
  For any system with characteristic energy <span class="math">\( E_{\text{system}} \)</span>, the effective tick time scales as:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_{\text{system}} = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{E_{\text{system}}} \)</p>
<p>
  For the electron, with rest energy 
  <span class="math">\( E_e = m_e c^2 \)</span>, the effective tick time is:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_e = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  Multiplying by the speed of light 
  <span class="math">\( c \)</span> transforms this tick time into a length scale:
</p>
<p class="math">\( L_e = c \times \tau_e = c \times \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  We identify <span class="math">\( L_e \)</span> with the electron’s Compton wavelength:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \lambda_C = \frac{\hbar}{m_e c} \)</p>

<h3>2.3 The Classical Electron Radius and the Fine-Structure Constant</h3>
<p>
  The classical electron radius, representing the scale of electromagnetic self-interaction, is given by:
</p>
<p class="math">\( r_e = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  The fine-structure constant is then determined by the ratio:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \alpha = \frac{r_e}{\lambda_C} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c} \)</p>
<p>
  Numerically, this yields <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Incorporating the Fractal Correction Factor</h3>
<p>
  To reflect the non-Euclidean, fractal nature of the tick update process, we introduce an effective fractal correction factor:
  <span class="math">\( D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667 \)</span>. This factor modifies the derived length scales.
</p>
<p>
  For example, the corrected electron Compton wavelength becomes:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \lambda'_C = \lambda_C \times D_{\text{eff}} \)</p>
<p>
  Likewise, when we adjust mass‐based systems (like the proton) using the effective energy, we derive a “bare” radius 
  which can later be modified by fractal corrections if needed.
</p>

<h3>3. Proton Calculations</h3>
<p>
  We now extend our framework to the proton. The proton is characterized by a much higher energy scale,
  taken as <span class="math">\( E_p \approx 1.5\,\text{GeV} = 1.5 \times 10^{9}\,\text{eV} \)</span>.
</p>
<p>
  For mass-based systems such as the proton, we use the effective energy:
</p>
<p class="math">\( E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{9}\,E_{\text{ref}} \)</p>
<p>
  Thus, the effective tick time for the proton becomes:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_p = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{eff}}}{E_p} \)</p>
<p>
  Substituting the numerical values:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_p \approx 0.6 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{s} \times \frac{6.12 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}}{1.5 \times 10^{9}\,\text{eV}} \approx 2.45 \times 10^{-24}\,\text{s} \)</p>
<p>
  Converting the tick time into a spatial scale using 
  <span class="math">\( c \)</span>:
</p>
<p class="math">\( r_p = c \times \tau_p \approx 3 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s} \times 2.45 \times 10^{-24}\,\text{s} \approx 7.35 \times 10^{-16}\,\text{m} \)</p>
<p>
  In femtometers, this gives a “bare” proton radius of approximately <span class="math">\( r_p \approx 0.74\,\text{fm} \)</span>.
</p>
<p>
  One may also incorporate the fractal correction factor to adjust spatial distributions. For example, one could define an adjusted radius,
  <span class="math">\( r'_p = r_p \times D_{\text{eff}} \)</span>. However, applying this directly would yield 
  <span class="math">\( 0.74\,\text{fm} \times 2.667 \approx 1.97\,\text{fm} \)</span>, which is considerably larger than the “bare” radius.
  The appropriate application of the fractal factor may depend on the context—whether it modifies the effective interaction volume, energy density, or simply serves as a correction in
  specific observables.
</p>

<h3>4. Discussion and Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Our digital tick-based model unifies the emergence of fundamental physical scales by assigning discrete, error-correcting updates to the fabric of nature.
  By scaling the universal reference tick time and energy to a system's characteristic energy—and using an effective energy of 
  <span class="math">\( E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{9}\,E_{\text{ref}} \)</span> for mass-related calculi—we naturally derive intrinsic length scales.
  In the electron, the interplay between quantum uncertainty and electromagnetic self-interaction yields the Compton wavelength and classical radius,
  whose ratio produces the fine-structure constant <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Extending this reasoning to the proton, our model predicts a “bare” proton radius of roughly <span class="math">\( 0.74\,\text{fm} \)</span>. 
  Additional corrections such as the fractal factor <span class="math">\( D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667 \)</span> can be contextually applied—depending on how the effective geometry 
  of the updates influences the observable parameters. For the simple tick-scaling derivation, however, the effective proton radius remains near 0.74 fm,
  which is consistent with many experimental extractions, before any further geometric corrections.
</p>
<p>
  This framework provides a fresh, fundamental derivation of key constants and offers new insights into nuclear structure and high-energy phenomena.
  Future work will focus on refining the application of the fractal correction factor and extending the model to incorporate inter-nucleon interactions 
  as well as gravitational and cosmological scales.

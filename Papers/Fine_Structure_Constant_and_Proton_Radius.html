<h2>Derivation of the Fine-Structure Constant and Proton Radius from a Discrete Tick-Based Error Correction Model</h2>
<br>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
  We propose a fundamental mechanism in which nature updates its state in discrete, error-correcting ticks.
  In this framework, observable quantities such as length scales and coupling constants emerge naturally.
  We derive the fine-structure constant 
  <span class="math">\( \alpha \)</span> 
  as the ratio of the classical electron radius to the electron’s Compton wavelength, and extend our approach to
  calculate the proton radius from first principles. In our model, the full 3D tick energy is 
  <span class="math">\( E_{\text{ref}} \approx 6.89\,\text{meV} \)</span>, while for mass-based systems only \( \frac{8}{9} \) of this energy is effective.
</p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
  Conventional theories like quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the Standard Model rely on renormalization 
  and empirical fittings to account for fundamental parameters. One enduring mystery is the value of the fine-structure 
  constant, <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>. Our digital tick-based model circumvents 
  this need by positing discrete updates of nature—ticks—that enforce intrinsic energy and length scales, 
  thereby naturally deriving constants like <span class="math">\( \alpha \)</span> and resolving puzzles such as the proton radius.
</p>

<h3>2. The Tick-Based Model</h3>
<br>
<h3>2.1 Reference Tick Time and Energy</h3>
<p>
  We postulate a universal reference tick time, <span class="math">\( \tau_{\text{ref}} \)</span>, and a corresponding 
  reference energy, <span class="math">\( E_{\text{ref}} \)</span>. For our model we set:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reference tick time:</strong> <span class="math">\( \tau_{\text{ref}} = 0.6 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{s} \)</span></li>
  <li><strong>Full 3D Reference energy:</strong> <span class="math">\( E_{\text{ref}} \approx 6.89\,\text{meV} \)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em>Note:</em> For mass-based calculations we assume that only \( \frac{8}{9} \) of this energy is effective,
  so that the effective energy is 
  <span class="math">\( E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{9}\,E_{\text{ref}} \approx 6.12\,\text{meV} \)</span>.
  When comparing with measurements, however, the full 3D energy is the relevant input.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Scaling to the Electron</h3>
<p>
  For any system with characteristic energy <span class="math">\( E_{\text{system}} \)</span>, the effective tick 
  time scales as:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_{\text{system}} = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{E_{\text{system}}} \)</p>
<p>
  For the electron, with rest energy 
  <span class="math">\( E_e = m_e c^2 \)</span>, the effective tick time is:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_e = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  Multiplying by the speed of light 
  <span class="math">\( c \)</span> transforms this tick time into a length scale:
</p>
<p class="math">\( L_e = c \times \tau_e = c \times \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  We identify <span class="math">\( L_e \)</span> with the electron’s Compton wavelength:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \lambda_C = \frac{\hbar}{m_e c} \)</p>

<h3>2.3 The Classical Electron Radius and the Fine-Structure Constant</h3>
<p>
  The classical electron radius, which represents the scale of electromagnetic self-interaction, is given by:
</p>
<p class="math">\( r_e = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  The fine-structure constant is then determined by the ratio:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \alpha = \frac{r_e}{\lambda_C} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c} \)</p>
<p>
  Numerically, this yields <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>.
</p>

<h3>2.4 On the Fractal Correction Factor</h3>
<p>
  In some aspects of the digital tick-based model, a fractal correction factor, 
  <span class="math">\( D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667 \)</span>, is introduced to account for non-Euclidean, fractal geometries,
  particularly when dealing with energy densities or gravitational parameters. However, for directly measured spatial quantities
  like the proton radius, the full 3D energy scale is appropriate. Thus, while \( D_{\text{eff}} \) may play a role in other observables,
  it is not applied as a direct multiplicative correction to the proton radius.
</p>

<h3>3. Proton Calculations</h3>
<p>
  We now extend our framework to the proton. The proton is characterized by a much higher energy scale,
  taken as <span class="math">\( E_p \approx 1.5\,\text{GeV} = 1.5 \times 10^{9}\,\text{eV} \)</span>.
</p>
<p>
  For mass-based systems such as the proton, if one uses the effective energy
  <span class="math">\( E_{\text{eff}} = \frac{8}{9}\,E_{\text{ref}} \)</span>,
  the effective tick time is:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_p = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{eff}}}{E_p} \)</p>
<p>
  Substituting the numerical values:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_p \approx 0.6 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{s} \times \frac{6.12 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}}{1.5 \times 10^{9}\,\text{eV}} \approx 2.45 \times 10^{-24}\,\text{s} \)</p>
<p>
  Converting the tick time into a spatial scale using 
  <span class="math">\( c \)</span>:
</p>
<p class="math">\( r_p = c \times \tau_p \approx 3 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s} \times 2.45 \times 10^{-24}\,\text{s} \approx 7.35 \times 10^{-16}\,\text{m} \)</p>
<p>
  This "bare" proton radius is approximately <span class="math">\( 0.74\,\text{fm} \)</span>. To reconcile with experimental values
  near 0.83–0.84 fm, one may apply a correction factor of \( \frac{9}{8} \) (restoring the full 3D energy) so that:
</p>
<p class="math">\( 0.74\,\text{fm} \times \frac{9}{8} \approx 0.83\,\text{fm} \)</p>
<p>
  This result aligns well with measured values, and no further multiplicative fractal correction, such as a factor of 2.667,
  is applied directly to the proton radius.
</p>

<h3>4. Discussion and Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  Our digital tick-based model unifies the emergence of fundamental physical scales by assigning discrete, error-correcting updates to the fabric of nature.
  By scaling the universal reference tick time and energy to a system's characteristic energy—and by using the full 3D energy scale for spatial properties—we naturally derive intrinsic length scales.
  In the electron, the interplay between quantum uncertainty and electromagnetic self–interaction yields the Compton wavelength and classical radius,
  whose ratio produces the fine-structure constant <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Extending this reasoning to the proton, our model predicts a “bare” proton radius around 0.74 fm (using the effective energy),
  and restoring to the full 3D scale by a factor of \( \frac{9}{8} \) yields a proton radius near 0.83–0.84 fm.
  This is consistent with experimental observations. The fractal correction factor \( D_{\text{eff}} = 2.667 \) remains relevant in other aspects
  of the theory (for example, in adjusting energy densities or gravitational couplings) but is not applied directly to the proton radius.
</p>
<p>
  This framework provides a fresh, fundamental derivation of key constants and offers new insights into nuclear structure and high-energy phenomena.
  Future work will focus on refining the incorporation of fractal corrections in contexts where they apply, as well as extending the model to incorporate inter-nucleon
  interactions and gravitational and cosmological scales.

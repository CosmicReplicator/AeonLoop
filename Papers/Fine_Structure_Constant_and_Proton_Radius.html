<h1>Derivation of the Fine-Structure Constant and Proton Radius from a Discrete Tick-Based Error Correction Model</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
  We propose a fundamental mechanism in which nature updates its state in discrete, error-correcting ticks.
  In this framework, observable quantities such as length scales and coupling constants emerge naturally.
  We derive the fine-structure constant 
  <span class="math">\( \alpha \)</span> 
  as the ratio of the classical electron radius to the electron’s Compton wavelength, and extend our approach to
  calculate the proton radius from first principles.
</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
  Conventional theories like quantum electrodynamics (QED) and the Standard Model rely on renormalization 
  and empirical fittings to account for fundamental parameters. One enduring mystery is the value of the fine-structure 
  constant, <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>. Our digital tick-based model circumvents 
  this need by positing discrete updates of nature—ticks—that enforce intrinsic energy and length scales, 
  thereby naturally deriving constants like <span class="math">\( \alpha \)</span> and resolving puzzles such as the proton radius.
</p>

<h2>2. The Tick-Based Model</h2>

<h3>2.1 Reference Tick Time and Energy</h3>
<p>
  We postulate a universal reference tick time, <span class="math">\( \tau_{\text{ref}} \)</span>, and a corresponding 
  reference energy, <span class="math">\( E_{\text{ref}} \)</span>. For our model we set:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Reference tick time:</strong> <span class="math">\( \tau_{\text{ref}} = 0.6 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{s} \)</span></li>
  <li><strong>Reference energy:</strong> <span class="math">\( E_{\text{ref}} \approx 6.89\,\text{meV} \)</span></li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Scaling to the Electron</h3>
<p>
  For any system with characteristic energy <span class="math">\( E_{\text{system}} \)</span>, the effective tick 
  time scales as:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_{\text{system}} = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{E_{\text{system}}} \)</p>
<p>
  For the electron, with rest energy 
  <span class="math">\( E_e = m_e c^2 \)</span>, the effective tick time is:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_e = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  Multiplying by the speed of light 
  <span class="math">\( c \)</span> transforms this time into a length scale:
</p>
<p class="math">\( L_e = c \times \tau_e = c \times \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  We identify <span class="math">\( L_e \)</span> with the electron’s Compton wavelength:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \lambda_C = \frac{\hbar}{m_e c} \)</p>

<h3>2.3 The Classical Electron Radius and the Fine-Structure Constant</h3>
<p>
  The classical electron radius, representing the scale of electromagnetic self-interaction, is given by:
</p>
<p class="math">\( r_e = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 m_e c^2} \)</p>
<p>
  The fine-structure constant is then determined by the ratio:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \alpha = \frac{r_e}{\lambda_C} = \frac{e^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c} \)</p>
<p>
  Numerically, this yields <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>.
</p>

<h2>3. Proton Calculations</h2>
<p>
  We now extend our framework to the proton. The proton is characterized by a much higher energy scale,
  taken as <span class="math">\( E_p \approx 1.5\,\text{GeV} = 1.5 \times 10^{9}\,\text{eV} \)</span>.
</p>
<p>
  The effective tick time for the proton follows as:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_p = \tau_{\text{ref}} \times \frac{E_{\text{ref}}}{E_p} \)</p>
<p>
  Substituting the numerical values:
</p>
<p class="math">\( \tau_p = 0.6 \times 10^{-12}\,\text{s} \times \frac{6.89 \times 10^{-3}\,\text{eV}}{1.5 \times 10^{9}\,\text{eV}} \approx 2.75 \times 10^{-24}\,\text{s} \)</p>
<p>
  Converting the tick time into a spatial scale using 
  <span class="math">\( c \)</span>:
</p>
<p class="math">\( r_p = c \times \tau_p \approx 3 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s} \times 2.75 \times 10^{-24}\,\text{s} \approx 8.25 \times 10^{-16}\,\text{m} \)</p>
<p>
  In femtometers, this gives <span class="math">\( r_p \approx 0.83\,\text{fm} \)</span>, in excellent agreement with experimental measurements.
</p>

<h2>4. Discussion and Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  Our digital tick-based model unifies the emergence of fundamental physical scales by assigning discrete, error-correcting updates to the fabric of nature. By scaling the universal reference tick time and energy to a system's characteristic energy, we naturally derive intrinsic lengths.
  In the electron, the balance of quantum uncertainty and electromagnetic self-interaction yields the Compton wavelength and classical radius,
  whose ratio produces the fine-structure constant <span class="math">\( \alpha \approx \frac{1}{137} \)</span>.
</p>
<p>
  Extending this reasoning to the proton, our model predicts a proton radius of approximately <span class="math">\( 0.83\,\text{fm} \)</span>, thereby offering a new perspective on the proton radius puzzle.
  This framework provides a fresh, fundamental derivation of these constants and opens avenues to explore nuclear structure and high-energy phenomena with a discrete time dynamics approach.
</p>
<p>
  Future work will aim to incorporate inter-nucleon interactions and further examine the implications for gravitational and cosmological scales.

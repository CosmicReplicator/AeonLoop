<p><strong>Neutrino, Digital Time Tick &amp; Beta Decay Explanation</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. The Digital Time Tick</strong></p>
<p>Our model proposes that nature is fundamentally digital. Every tick is a
discrete unit of time lasting approximately 0.6 picoseconds (ps). Each
tick is associated with a fixed energy quantum of about 6.9
millielectronvolts (meV). This uniform tick acts as an error‑correction
mechanism, ensuring that the energy in each time interval remains
consistent.</p>
<p><strong>2. Right‑Handed (RH) Neutrinos</strong></p>
<p>In this framework, the right‑handed neutrino is synonymous with the
digital tick itself. It embodies the fundamental time unit---its 6.9 meV
energy is locked into every 0.6 ps tick, making it the clockwork of the
universe. Because of its role in error correction, the RH neutrino is
never observed as a free particle.</p>
<p><strong>3. Left‑Handed (LH) Neutrinos</strong></p>
<p>Left‑handed neutrinos are produced along with their right‑handed
counterparts. However, due to their 'wrong' chirality relative to the
RH tick, they do not get absorbed into the time‑reset mechanism. To
avoid being corrected away, the LH neutrinos must carry the same fixed
energy (6.9 meV) but manifest a subtle effective mass shift that allows
them to propagate freely. These free LH neutrinos are the ones observed
in weak interactions.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fractal Structure: Effective Dimension 2.667</strong></p>
<p>A key aspect of our model is that space is not a perfect 3D
continuum---it behaves as if it has an effective fractal dimension of
2.667. In traditional energy/mass equations, integration over 3D space
yields certain values. However, with an effective dimension of 2.667,
there is a correction factor of roughly 2.667/3 (approximately 8/9) that
must be applied. This factor adjusts the energy summation (or discrete
tick counting) and, via E = mc², the derived mass of particles.</p>
<p><strong>5. Beta Decay Explanation</strong></p>
<p>Consider beta decay (such as the neutron decaying into a proton,
electron, and antineutrino) with a Q‑value of approximately 1.293 MeV.
Within our Digital-Time Tick Model, this overall energy release is built
up from a number of discrete ticks. Dividing the total energy by the
tick energy:

Number of ticks = Q-value / (6.9 meV) ≈ 1.293 MeV / 6.9 meV ≈ 187.000.000 ticks.

However, the error‑correction inherent in the system forces every
digital tick to have exactly 6.9 meV. As a result, the free left‑handed
neutrino (which escapes as one of the decay products) is constrained to
carry exactly one tick's worth of energy (6.9 meV). The rest of the
energy is partitioned among the electron's kinetic energy and the recoil
of the proton. This quantized view offers a novel insight into how beta
decay distributes energy among its products.</p>
<p><strong>6. Summary</strong></p>
<p>• The Digital Time Tick has a duration of 0.6 ps and an energy of 6.9
meV, serving as the fundamental unit of time and the basis of error
correction.
• Right‑Handed Neutrinos are built into each tick, meaning they are
never seen as free particles---they define the clockwork of the
universe.
• Left‑Handed Neutrinos, produced alongside RH neutrinos, remain free
and interact via the weak force. They inherit the fixed tick energy but
exhibit a slight mass shift owing to their chirality.
• The effective fractal dimension of space (2.667) introduces an 8/9
correction factor in mass/energy computations, linking the discrete
ticks to the observable mass.
• In beta decay, while the overall decay energy is decomposed into about
187 ticks, error correction ensures the free neutrino carries exactly
6.9 meV.</p>

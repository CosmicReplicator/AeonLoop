    <p>Digital-Tick Lagrangian</p>
<p><strong>1. Discrete Digital Update</strong></p>
<p>In our digital-tick model, spacetime updates occur in discrete intervals
(Δt = 0.6 ps) corresponding to a frequency of 1.667 THz. This replaces
continuous time evolution with a finite difference scheme. For example,
the electromagnetic four--potential Aₘ evolves as:\
\
Aₘ(t + Δt, x) = Aₘ(t, x) + Δt · (dAₘ/dt) + O((Δt)²),\
\
and spatial derivatives are approximated with a step Δx = c Δt ≈ 0.18
mm.</p>
<p><strong>2. Classical Electromagnetic Lagrangian</strong></p>
<p>The traditional electromagnetic Lagrangian is given by:\
\
  ℒ = -¼ FₘₙFᵐⁿ,\
\
where the field tensor Fₘₙ is defined as:\
\
  Fₘₙ = ∂ₘ Aₙ - ∂ₙ Aₘ.\
\
In our framework, we reinterpret the continuous derivatives as finite
differences, and the quadratic form (Fₘₙ²) naturally penalizes any phase
mismatch. This ensures built-in error correction and phase coherence
throughout the digital updates.</p>
<p><strong>3. Emergence from Digital Updates</strong></p>
<p>The Lagrangian in the digital-tick framework is not an arbitrary
insertion, but emerges from the necessity to maintain coherence across
discrete updates. Each tick advances the field and enforces phase
alignment. The squared term in FₘₙFᵐⁿ quantifies the cost of deviations
from perfect coherence, thus driving error correction naturally. This is
why the form ℒ = -¼ FₘₙFᵐⁿ is preferred---it minimizes phase
discontinuities inherent in a discrete time evolution.</p>
<p><strong>4. Discrete Action and Euler--Lagrange Equations</strong></p>
<p>Instead of integrating over continuous time, our action is a sum over
digital ticks:\
\
  S = Σₙ ℒₙ Δt,\
\
where ℒₙ is the Lagrangian evaluated at the nth tick. Using a discrete
version of the Euler--Lagrange equations, we recover Maxwell's equations
in the continuum limit. This derivation not only reconstructs the
classical form of the Lagrangian but also explains why this form
naturally arises from the digital update mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>5. Broader Implications</strong></p>
<p>Reinterpreting the Lagrangian within a digital-tick framework does more
than reproduce known laws---it provides insight into why nature's
classical fields take their observed form. This perspective suggests
that similar digital updating and error-correcting mechanisms underlie
gravitational phenomena, neutrino mass scales, and perhaps even other
fundamental interactions, unifying diverse phenomena under a single,
coherent digital architecture of spacetime.</p>
